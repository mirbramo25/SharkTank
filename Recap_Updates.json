For this reason, he was out next.<\/p><p>\nRobert said he didn’t want to be a Grinch, but he was “not seeing the growth curve.” Because he didn’t believe it would scale attractively, he too was out. Barbara applauded Scott's mission, but urged him to consider his fairly meager profit of $33,000 as an indicator that something is wrong. For that reason, Barbara was out.<\/p><p>\nMark, on the other hand, voiced his reservations but provided Scott the opportunity to explain the merits of his business further. When Scott said that scaling would create an estimated 200 additional jobs, Mark offered $150,000 for 40% equity.<\/p><p>\nWithout negotiation, Scott accepted, and the deal was made.

Kevin O’Leary came in with one of  \"Mr. Wonderful\" royalty deals. He offered $90,000, but he wanted a 5% royalty of everything in return.<\/p><p>\nLori offered an incredible $900,000 in exchange for 30% equity. Daymond John decided to offer $1 million in exchange for 25% equity. Lori and Daymond bickered about who would do things better for Michael and PlateTopper, but Robert Herjavec interrupted to find out if Michael was seriously considering Kevin’s offer. Michael candidly said he was not, and that he would like to respectfully decline Mr. Wonderful’s offer.<\/p><p>\nAt this juncture, things started getting messy. Michael began talking about the valuation, and how he believed his company to be worth considerably more than the $1.8 million valuation that his original ask was structured around. For this reason, Daymond went out, stating that Michael was starting to rub him the wrong way.<\/p><p>\nAt this point, Lori reconsidered her offer and decided to roll it back from $900,000 to $90,000 in exchange for 5%. Lori was now offering exactly what Michael asked for, yet he didn’t accept. Robert went out next, unwilling to take any risks investing.<\/p><p>\nThe sharks continued pushing Michael to come clean about his true valuation since he was unwilling to accept the $90,000 for 5% deal he originally asked for, and he finally agreed to reveal the real offer he had in mind, which was $750,000 for 5%. This assumed PlateTopper was worth $15 million that day, an assumption the sharks were not eager to make.<\/p><p>\nMark Cuban, undeterred by the seemingly wishy-washy behavior shown by Michael, asked him how much a line of credit would be worth to him. Michael excused himself from the tank to call his younger brother, and when he returned, he asked for $1.5 million in exchange for 10% equity. With that, Mark went out.<\/p><p>\nWhen Michael started to counter Mark, rather than talk to Lori about her offer, she amended her offer again, to $90,000 for 10% equity. Michael countered with 5% for the $90,000, and asked if any sharks wanted to come back in, even asking if the sharks would have a bidding war for his company. The sharks adamantly rejected this, and Lori said she would do $90,000 for 8% equity if Michael accepted immediately.<\/p><p>\nFinally, Michael accepted the offer and the deal was closed. His pitch would go down in Shark Tank history as the longest and most drawn out segment. What happened next for the company? Keep reading our PlateTopper update to find out!<\/p><p>\nAs it would turn out, the deal with Lori never closed. Despite this,  PlateTopper continued selling on QVC and in WalMart stores. Michael would then develop a bowl topper, and sell various products in retail stores and online. However, the PlateTopper would disappear from shelves and sales would be discontinued online as well. As of October 2022, the company is out of business. This will be our final PlateTopper update.<\/p>\n"},"Halloween Moments Pumpkin Scraper Glove":{"recapLink":"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/halloween-moments-update-shark-tank-season-14\/","recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/halloween-moments-update-shark-tank-season-14\">Shark Tank Halloween Moments Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Our Halloween Moments update revealed that the company's flagship product, The Pumpkin Glove Scraper Kit, gained traction in major retail stores like Walmart shortly after its episode aired.<\/p><p>\nThe product also became available on Amazon, reaching a broader audience.<\/p><p>\nCustomers could purchase the kits directly from the <a href=\"https:\/\/halloweenmoments.com\/\">company's official website.<\/a><\/p><p>\nHowever, the company's momentum seemed to wane after November 2022.<\/p><p>\nIts social media accounts became inactive, and updates on the company's progress or plans were notably sparse.<\/p><p>\nOur research into the Halloween Moments update found that the <a href=\"https:\/\/geeksaroundglobe.com\/halloween-moments-net-worth-update\/\">company's net worth<\/a> is approximately $3 million, and its annual revenue was around $50,000 at the time of this writing.<\/p><p>\nWe can't wait to bring you another Halloween Moments update.<\/p>\n"},"Tucky Belt":{"recapLink":"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/tucky-update-shark-tank-season-14\/","recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/tucky-update-shark-tank-season-14\"><strong>Shark Tank Tucky Update<\/strong><\/a><\/h2>\n<p>We have great news to share in our Tucky update!

Oh, and when you're cutting, be sure to point it down at a 45-degree angle to get it started.

She revealed that she would make no profit that year whatsoever, and had made no profit at all from The Green Garmento. The sharks were stunned. Jennie tried to brush past, saying she was “just four years in” and it was too early to expect profits, but the sharks disagreed. How could a company generate $1 million in sales and see no return on investment? For the sharks, this was a massive red flag.<\/p><p>\nRobert asked how much money Jennie was losing, and Jennie said she was losing $10,000 per month. He asked how much she lost last year, and Jennie claimed that she didn’t know. She violated the Shark Tank cardinal rule– know thy numbers!<\/p><p>\nJennie continued peeling back layers, and revealed that she had invested $380,000 into her product, and also had taken on a collection of “non-equity investors.” The sharks were stunned again, and Mark asked what the investors got for their money if not equity.<\/p><p>\nJennie said that these investors were receiving 9% of all revenue off the top until their money was paid back. Mark asked how much money she took from these investors, and Jennie answered that she had accepted $900,000 from them.<\/p><p>\nKevin asked how much of the $900,000 Jennie had already paid back, and she said “not very much.” With the truth finally coming to light, the sharks would fall like dominoes. Robert went first, telling Jennie she had a great product, but he couldn’t see past the elephant in the room. For that reason, he was out.<\/p><p>\nBarbara left next, also applauding the product design, but stating she could not justify “buying into a problem.” Kevin would not go quietly, sharing the cold, hard truth about green products and claiming that everyone wants to save the world unless it costs them something. He said this was the reason why solar “doesn’t work,” wind “doesn’t work,” and why The Green Garmento “won’t work.” He was out.<\/p><p>\nMark left the tank with a lesson. He said that many investors followed her path, accruing debt under the assumption that more money would make their business successful. They, and Jennie, would learn the hard way that “debt is not your friend.” With that, Mark was out. The last shark remaining was Daymond, and he didn't remain long. He too was out.<\/p><p>\nWith no offers from the sharks, Jennie was forced to leave the tank without a deal. How did things go for Jennie after the pitch?

With help from the sharks, she's hoping to finally improve production, logistics, sales, and marketing.<\/p><p>\nFran's plan was to have an online and retail presence. While the sharks saw her vision, they were concerned that getting freezer space in a retail store would be difficult.

Fran agreed that there should be a powder option, especially for the online store, but felt that a liquid option was important too.<\/p><p>\nAfter this, Mark dropped out because he already had a deal with some of her competitors. Kevin O'Leary, Daymond John, and Lori Greiner gracefully bowed out because they did not want to get into the drink space.<\/p><p>\nBarbara, however, saw something in Fran. She was impressed by Fran's undeniable sales charisma and pitch perfection. She offered $100,000 upfront with a $250,000 line of credit. But there was a catch.<\/p><p>\nShe wanted a 40% stake in the business.<\/p><p>\nFran thanked Barbara for the offer and shared that she had potential backing from two sports legends - an NFL and an NBA Hall of Famer. Fran tried to use this to negotiate Barbara down to 25%.<\/p><p>\nBarbara agreed to drop down to 30% if, and only if, Fran could bring in one of the Hall of Famers.

The box itself is very heavy, so be prepared to have some help if you have trouble lifting things over 25 pounds. However, once it was all out of the box, it was pretty easy to assemble and put together.<\/p><p>\nThe instruction manual does a good job of explaining how to put the pieces together and connect them to a propane tank. We have a propane fireplace on our back porch, so we simply connected it to that.<\/p><p>\nYou can cook your pizza with propane, wood chips, or charcoal. We weren't prepared for the wood chips (next time), so we just did it with propane. There are a handful of <a href=\"https:\/\/bertello.com\/pages\/videos-1\">videos on the website<\/a> that you'll want to follow before you cook your pizza. I neglected to watch the videos and ran into a few hiccups. Mainly, we made the pizzas a little too big and didn't let the stone get hot enough.<\/p><p>\nFor reference, you'll want to let the stone sit in the oven for 30 minutes to heat up to around 700-900 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, for the pizza, you'll want to make it about the size of a personal pizza, not the size of one you'd get from the store. Thankfully, they only take a few minutes to cook so it's easy to quickly cook a couple of them.<\/p><p>\nSince we didn't make our own dough and simply bought some dough from the grocery store, we didn't quite have enough flour on the bottom of it and had a hard time transferring it from the pan to the stone in the oven. However, we were able to add some flour to the bottom of the second and third pizzas and the transfer was much smoother.<\/p><p>\nPortable Pizza Oven<\/p><p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bertello-Outdoor-Pizza-Black-Combo\/dp\/B08B5HZ3CN?tag=sharktankrecap-20\"> Bertello Outdoor Pizza Oven Black + Pizza Peel Combo <\/a><\/p><p>\n__<\/p><p>\nThe Bertello Outdoor Pizza Oven - Wood and Gas-Fired Outdoor Pizza Oven is the most affordable, high quality, portable, wood fire, charcoal, pellet, and gas outdoor pizza oven available.<\/p><p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bertello-Outdoor-Pizza-Black-Combo\/dp\/B08B5HZ3CN?tag=sharktankrecap-20\"> <img src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20500'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" alt=\"Bertello Outdoor Pizza Oven Black + Pizza Peel Combo\" \/><img src=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41a5fQclVGL._SL500_.jpg\" alt=\"Bertello Outdoor Pizza Oven Black + Pizza Peel Combo\" \/> <\/a><\/p><p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bertello-Outdoor-Pizza-Black-Combo\/dp\/B08B5HZ3CN?tag=sharktankrecap-20\"> Check Price on Amazon <\/a><\/p><p>\nWe earn a commission if you make a purchase, at no additional cost to you.<\/p><p>\nOverall, my experience with the Bertello pizza oven was great!

The rebranding coincided with an investment from Patrick Schwarzenegger, son of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who later appeared on Shark Tank with his company, <a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/mosh-update-season-15\/\">Mosh<\/a>.<\/p><p>\nOur Sunniva Super Coffee update found that the company expanded its product line to include creamers in 2019. It secured a $25 million investment from prominent venture capitalists, including Aaron Rodgers' company, Rx3 Ventures.<\/p><p>\nThe investment secured Sunniva Super Coffee's place in the competitive beverage market. Forbes recognized the brothers in their prestigious 30 Under 30 list in 2019. By 2020, Kitu Life's sales had skyrocketed to $55 million.<\/p><p>\nThe company's investor pool gained star power with former NBA star Baron Davis joining, followed by celebrities Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod) and Jennifer Lopez.<\/p><p>\nIn 2021, Sunniva Super Coffee (Kitu Life) appointed Rosanna Godden, formerly the finance vice president at Whole Foods Market, as its chief financial officer.<\/p><p>\nThe company underwent a leadership change in 2022. Rosanna Godden departed her role as CFO, and Tyler Ricks, a seasoned executive with experience at major coffee and tea companies, was welcomed as the new CEO.<\/p><p>\nDespite the leadership shift, Sunniva Super Coffee maintained its impressive financial performance. The company projected sales of $97 million for 2021 and boasted a valuation of $400 million.<\/p><p>\nA critical factor in this success was a strategic partnership forged with Anheuser-Busch in late 2020.<\/p><p>\nThis deal granted Sunniva Super Coffee access to a vast distribution network, allowing them to place their products in major retailers like Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Target, and numerous convenience stores nationwide.<\/p><p>\nIn 2021, the company secured an additional $106 million in investment, pushing its valuation to a staggering $500 million.<\/p><p>\nWhile their products were only available in approximately 40% of U.S. retail outlets, Kitu Life had already established itself as the third-largest bottled coffee manufacturer in the country, trailing only Starbucks and Dunkin'.<\/p><p>\nThey brokered an Anheuser-Busch partnership, which promised to expand their reach further, potentially propelling them to the number one position.<\/p><p>\nIn April 2022, Sunniva Super Coffee's sales projection crossed the $100 million mark. In May, it announced a partnership with rapper Vanilla Ice to <a href=\"https:\/\/drinksupercoffee.com\/products\/coffee\/vanilla-super-coffee\/\">promote its new Vanilla Iced Latte flavor. <\/a><\/p><p>\nKitu Life is exploring an initial public offering (IPO) as a means to fuel global expansion. By February 2023, Kitu Life announced that 2022 sales had reached a new high of $124 million.<\/p><p>\nSo, despite leaving Shark Tank without a deal, we're calling this Sunniva Super Coffee update a success!<\/p>\n"},"You Smell Soap":{"recapLink":"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/you-smell-soap-shark-tank-season-3\/","recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/you-smell-soap-shark-tank-season-3\/\">Shark Tank You Smell Soap Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Our You Smell Soap update reveals that the deal with Robert was never finalized.

I couldn’t believe it!<\/p><p>\nIt still tasted like a lemon, but it was more sweet and tart instead of sour and tart.<\/p><p>\nOne thing to note is that my wife and I only tried half a berry, for the full experience you’re supposed to eat a full berry.
