They share a gourmet meal and Daymond says these businesses have combined sales of over $11 million since appearing on Shark Tank. He thinks they are all going to an entirely new level.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the Marvel deal, the company did licensing deals with Disney, Pokemon, Nintendo, Warner Bros and more. Their success didn&#8217;t go unnoticed as hundreds of knock offs flooded the marketplace. They managed to remove more than 1,000 imitators off of Amazon, eBay and some other major retailers. Their efforts actually led to arrests in China.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the company&#8217;s mission is  improving lives in their community and beyond. They regularly give money to a variety of charities including Toys for Tots, Autism Speaks and others.

His future plans include expanding his line of personal care products and improving the NOHBO balls themselves before licensing the idea out to major shampoo and conditioner companies. It&#8217;s too soon to tell if NOHBO will be a hit. Benjamin may be a bit wet behind the ears at 17, but his determination and innovation will serve him well going forward.<\/p>\n<h3>Making Changes<\/h3>\n<p>In 2018, Stern pivoted and stopped using the powdered form of balls. There were too many problems. He teamed with a chemist closer to his Melbourne, Florida headquarters, switched to a gel format and re-branded the product NOHBO Drops. As of March, 2020, Stern has 76 million purchase orders scheduled for the next four years in Europe and he just closed a $3.5 million round of venture funding. NOHBO gets an update segment in season eleven, episode 1115.<\/p>\n<p>In the update, he tours his factory and reveals another round of funding. Mark thinks it could be a $100 million company in the next few years.<\/p>\n<p>In May, 2022, Stern rolled out his own consumer brand called <a href=\"https:\/\/sunrisesession.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Sunrise Session<\/a> which features NOHBO like products. The business won the People&#8217;s Choice Award at the New York Society of Cosmetic Chemists Suppliers’ Day 2022 in New York City. As of November, 2022, Stern has licensed his technology to over 60 companies. In 2023, the company introduced Hydrofill &#8220;multi-dose water-soluble pods that contain an anhydrous hyper-concentrated base.&#8221; When the Hydrofill is added to a bottle of water and shaken, a standard-sized personal care product is generated.&#8221; Hydrofill products include shampoo, conditioner, body wash, face wash and shaving cream<\/p>\n<p>In January, 2023, the company announced it was joining the B Corp Beauty Coalition. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pr.com\/press-release\/876922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">press release<\/a>, it states the B Corp Beauty Coalition is &#8220;an organization that focuses on improving the sustainability standards of the cosmetic and beauty industries. They prioritize soil as much as they do skin. &#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As of July, 2024, annual revenue is $8 million.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts About NOHBO on Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/nohbo-balls\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">NOHBO Balls<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>NOHBO Company Information<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3xSjEbi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Search on Amazon<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/nohbo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SunriseSessionByNohbo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nohboball\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Video<br \/>\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/pnBL-ALryro\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/nohbo\/"},"title":"NOHBO | S7"},"Coldest Water Bottles":{"recap":{"recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/coldest-drinkware-update-shark-tank-season-15\/\">Coldest Update | S15<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Although the brothers struck out on Shark Tank, our Coldest update is a good one.

The company has grown quite a bit since the show and we were able to catch up with Susana to talk about what's happened since Shark Tank.<\/p><p>\n\"We've been super fortunate as the product seemed to have resonated well with a national audience,\" Susana told us. She continued, \"After the first night, we were backordered by 6 weeks and sold over 2,000 pillows within a few hours.\"<\/p><p>\nFortunately, Susana shared that this growth continued in the following months and as they released new products. \"We're on track to hit eight figures in 2023,\" Susana shared.<\/p><p>\nFurther, Susana also shared that \"each of our products has won a number of awards\" with the pillow itself winning over ten!<\/p><p>\nWith all the success, Pluto Pillow shows no signs of slowing down and Susana even teased some big plans for 2024.

After sleeping on it for a few weeks, I've got to say, it's pretty amazing and is now my favorite pillow I've used!<\/p><p>\nThe process of creating my pillow was incredibly simple. All that I had to do was visit the website and answer a few questions about my current pillow and sleeping habits. That's it!<\/p><p>\nOutside of the pillow, one thing that stood out to me was the packaging and presentation. The Pluto Pillow came in a custom-designed box and was wrapped beautifully. It had a note inside with my name handwritten on it and even included a piece of candy!<\/p><p>\nI've been sleeping on the pillow for about three weeks now and I can definitely tell a difference in how I sleep. I recently went on vacation and left my Pluto Pillow at home and after the first night of vacation, I wished that I brought it with me!<\/p><p>\nI would highly recommend trying out Pluto Pillow.

Kevin O’Leary came in with one of  \"Mr. Wonderful\" royalty deals. He offered $90,000, but he wanted a 5% royalty of everything in return.<\/p><p>\nLori offered an incredible $900,000 in exchange for 30% equity. Daymond John decided to offer $1 million in exchange for 25% equity. Lori and Daymond bickered about who would do things better for Michael and PlateTopper, but Robert Herjavec interrupted to find out if Michael was seriously considering Kevin’s offer. Michael candidly said he was not, and that he would like to respectfully decline Mr. Wonderful’s offer.<\/p><p>\nAt this juncture, things started getting messy. Michael began talking about the valuation, and how he believed his company to be worth considerably more than the $1.8 million valuation that his original ask was structured around. For this reason, Daymond went out, stating that Michael was starting to rub him the wrong way.<\/p><p>\nAt this point, Lori reconsidered her offer and decided to roll it back from $900,000 to $90,000 in exchange for 5%. Lori was now offering exactly what Michael asked for, yet he didn’t accept. Robert went out next, unwilling to take any risks investing.<\/p><p>\nThe sharks continued pushing Michael to come clean about his true valuation since he was unwilling to accept the $90,000 for 5% deal he originally asked for, and he finally agreed to reveal the real offer he had in mind, which was $750,000 for 5%. This assumed PlateTopper was worth $15 million that day, an assumption the sharks were not eager to make.<\/p><p>\nMark Cuban, undeterred by the seemingly wishy-washy behavior shown by Michael, asked him how much a line of credit would be worth to him. Michael excused himself from the tank to call his younger brother, and when he returned, he asked for $1.5 million in exchange for 10% equity. With that, Mark went out.<\/p><p>\nWhen Michael started to counter Mark, rather than talk to Lori about her offer, she amended her offer again, to $90,000 for 10% equity. Michael countered with 5% for the $90,000, and asked if any sharks wanted to come back in, even asking if the sharks would have a bidding war for his company. The sharks adamantly rejected this, and Lori said she would do $90,000 for 8% equity if Michael accepted immediately.<\/p><p>\nFinally, Michael accepted the offer and the deal was closed. His pitch would go down in Shark Tank history as the longest and most drawn out segment. What happened next for the company? Keep reading our PlateTopper update to find out!<\/p><p>\nAs it would turn out, the deal with Lori never closed. Despite this,  PlateTopper continued selling on QVC and in WalMart stores. Michael would then develop a bowl topper, and sell various products in retail stores and online. However, the PlateTopper would disappear from shelves and sales would be discontinued online as well.

Really tough.Due to the overwhelming amount of love and support we received last year, we grew really fast, a little too fast. As we came into 2017 we lacked the right infrastructure to support a growing company. We had issues with our website, a really small 3 person staff, and issues with paying our sellers. We made over projections and our business model completely failed. As the Founder and CEO of Zuvaa, I take full responsibility for this failure. My over projections and eagerness to scale Zuvaa without the proper support led to many of our issues. But these are all growing pains and part of the journey of building a company. I failed a lot of people and I&#8217;m working to rectify our mistakes so they never happen again. We stopped operations in the marketplace some weeks ago to address these issues. Our goal is to re-emerge in the new year with a better website, a better business model and a better way of serving the thousands of customers worldwide that have helped Zuvaa get where we are. Zuvaa is a young company with a big vision. We have barely scratched the surface on this opportunity. The continent is vast and we can&#8217;t wait to show you all the beautiful artistry coming out of Africa. But in the interim, we need to fix our operations, grow our team and make sure we are providing the best experiences for you and the community in general. Can you help us? I&#8217;m crowdfunding ideas and suggestions on how to make Zuvaa better. Whether it is regarding our website, social media, pricing, etc &#8211; I want to hear what you think. These are the realities of growing a company and I appreciate everyone who has been patient and supportive with Zuvaa during this difficult time.<\/p>\n<p>Any questions or concerns, feel reach out to me via email: kelechi@zuvaa.com.<\/p>\n<p>Cheers,<\/p>\n<p>Kelechi Anyadiegwu<\/p>\n<p>Founder + CEO, Zuvaa<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In February, 2020, she rebranded the business to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ujuumedia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Uju Media<\/a> and said the site would be up and running in 2021.

In June, 2021, Michael bought out Brian and Barbara&#8217;s shares as neither of them wanted to assume more risk.  Later in 2021, they were unable to get product from their Chinese factory in time for the 2021 holiday season due to increased customs bond costs.<\/p>\n<p>In February, 2022, the company fired their CEO. In March, 2022, the company&#8217;s now former CEO, Susan Hudson, sued the business for breach of employment agreement and promissory fraud, allegations the brothers deny. They claim they fired her because she spent too much on advertising, contributing to the company&#8217;s financial woes. Hudson claims she secured financing for the business to cover its bond costs in exchange for an equity stake. She claims the company&#8217;s financial woes are due to Barbara, Michael and Brian taking too much cash out, leaving the business cash strapped. The case is set to go to trial in September, 2023. The 2023 season will see Disney and college licensed Comfies on the market.<\/p>\n<h3>Going it Alone<\/h3>\n<p>In June, 2022, Michael bought out Brian and Barbera for an undisclosed amount. As of August, 2022, the company is still in business and doing around $15 million in annual sales.

Michael is seeking a buyer for the company as of February, 2023, and he&#8217;s determined to keep the company afloat whatever it takes.

In the update, Daymond and Bubba discuss the company&#8217;s burgeoning sales, $16 million to date!<\/p>\n<p>In October, 2019, Bubba closed his restaurant after 13 years in business. That&#8217;s as long as he played football. The ribs are still available to order from the company website. He also has products in 3000 or so grocery stores and he did a 1 million pound order with Hardee&#8217;s\/Carl&#8217;s Junior restaurants for a limited edition pork rib sandwich.<\/p>\n<p>The Covid-19 pandemic hurt sales and there was trouble behind the scenes. In May, 2023, Bubba revealed to an LA Times reporter he felt cheated by Daymond and the producers of Shark Tank. He claims he only recieved a little over $600,000 touted in the season 8 update. He also revealed the Daymond introduced him to Nate Holzapfel from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/mission-belt\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Mission Belt<\/a>. Nate helped the Bakers set up an eCommerce site to sell their products online and they did $250,000 in sales on show night. Nate, who&#8217;s since been indicted for multiple fraud counts, sexual harrassment and othe charges, controlled the business bank account and, when the Bakers terminated that arrangement, he closed up shop and sent them a check for just $8000.<\/p>\n<h3>More Trouble<\/h3>\n<p>In 2015, Bubba secured a licensing\/co-packing deal with Rastelli Foods Group.; The deal would give the Bakers 45% of sales revenue. The Bakers claim Daymond injected himself into the deal and the new terms were the Bakers got 45% of  sales, Rastelli got 35% and Daymond got 20%. After several $20,000 to $25,000 payments, the payments dwindled and both Daymond and Rastelli ceased communications with the Bakers. The Baker family also alleges the Carl&#8217;s Jr. deal, worth $5.8 million, only netted them $2,900 in net profits and a $61,917.45 licensing fee.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, Rastelli Foods sued the Bakers claiming they weren&#8217;t being forthright about the joint venture&#8217;s finances. The case was settled and Rastelli agreed to pay the Bakers $100,000 in installments. When the Bubba&#8217;s ribs business was sold, the installment payments dwindled. The Bakers, who were $170,000 in debt due to legal fees, were forced to shutter their business and sell their home (at a loss).<\/p>\n<p>After this story broke in May, 2023, Daymond sought a temporary restraining order against the Bakers. In a statement issued by Daymod&#8217;s spokesperson, it said the &#8220;temporary restraining order is due to the Bakers&#8217; blatant actions to undermine a business partnership and the legal parameters they agreed to four years ago. Their belief that they can unwind poor business decisions through slanderous social media posts and articles will no longer be tolerated.&#8221; Daymond himself called the accusations by the Bakers a &#8220;false narrative.&#8221; As of May, 2023, the ribs are still for sale on the company website. They are no longer available in stores.<\/p>\n<p>In July, 2023, both Daymond and Rastelli Foods obtained a permanent injunction against the Bakers, making the temporary restraining order permanent. The Bakers were ordered by the judge in the case to cease making any disparaging comments about Daymond and to remove all negative social media posts. By May, 2024, the website is down as is social media. It appears that they have gone out of business.

While Romero didn&#8217;t entice the Sharks, he has hit upon a winning business strategy that will support his &#8220;LA lifestyle&#8221; for many years to come.<\/p>\n<p>Nick finally got the patent for his machine in 2014. They moved out of their Venice location to a 5000 square foot facility in downtown LA and re branded to The AVE Los Angeles. With the patented technology, he was able to secure licensing agreements in the USA, Europe and Canada. This led to a partnership with NVR SHOES, the world&#8217;s first casual Shoe Brand with a shoe designed specifically for DTG Printing. The online store lets customers create their own designed shoes or choose from many pre-printed, licensed images on shoes. As of November, 2023, the company has $3 million in annual revenue.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts about The Ave Venice on Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/the-ave-venice-shark-tank-preview\/\" rel=\"bookmark\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Venice Custom Everything Seeks Investment<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The Ave Venice Company Information<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.theavevenice.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theavelosangeles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/theavela\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/the-ave-venice\/"},"title":"The Ave Venice | S3"},"Hillbilly Brand":{"recap":{"recapLink":"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/hillbilly-brand-clothing-line-update-shark-tank-season-2\/","recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/hillbilly-brand-clothing-line-update-shark-tank-season-2\/\">Shark Tank HillBilly Brand Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Our HillBilly Brand update shows that the deal with the sharks did not go through.

We&#8217;ll see if &#8220;something wonderful&#8221; is happening with this business.<\/p>\n<p>In 2018, they raised $12.5 million from venture firms Accomplice and Highland Capital Partners. In December, 2019, the company took in another $10 million from the same firms and others. Like a lot of companies, Lovepop pivoted during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. They converted some of their manufacturing machinery to produce face shields.<\/p>\n<p>In June, 2021, the company named Lisa Scopa as their new CEO. She will oversee a business that employs 800 people and does over $40 million in yearly sales. Also in 2021, the company opened six brick and mortar stores in Boston, California and Florida. Three more stores are slated for New York City in 2022. They also sell cards in hundreds of independent retailers world wide. By September, 2022, annual revenue is over $150 million.<\/p>\n<h3>Trouble Brewing<\/h3>\n<p>In January, 2023, the company raised another $5 million. $3 million was from the conversion of outstanding convertible securities and $2 million was new investment. In October, 2023, the company was the number 9 most successful Shark Tank company with $304 million in lifetime sales. In late April, 2024, the company sued 2 rivals in Federal Court in Colorado and New York, both for patent, copyright, and trademark infringement. The Colorado case involves Poplife, LLC and the New York case involves Paper Love,  LLC.<\/p>\n<p>In the Poplife case, LovePop contends the defendant is infringing on the patent for the technology that allows the cards to be three-dimensional. LovePop also claims copyright infringement for specific card designs. Their trademark infringement claims are based on the fact that Poplife&#8217;s logo is misleadingly similar to LovePop&#8217;s. The Paperlove case involves patent infringement on the pop up card technology. As of July, 2024, neither case has progressed beyond the filings.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts About Lovepop on Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/pop-up-greeting-cards-love-pop\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Pop Up Greeting Cards<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Lovepop Company Information<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3qDy1rX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">BUY NOW<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lovepopcards.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lovepopcards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lovepop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/lovepop\/"},"title":"Lovepop | S7"},"Copa Di Vino":{"recap":{"recapLink":"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/copa-di-vino-wine-filled-glasses-update-shark-tank-season-2\/","recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/copa-di-vino-wine-filled-glasses-update-shark-tank-season-2\/\">Shark Tank Copa di Vino Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Our Copa di Vino update shows that Copa di Vino has thrived since appearing on Shark Tank, achieving $20 million in annual sales and hitting a valuation of $70 million.

He also made an offer of $400,000 for a 4.85% stake.<\/p><p>\nDave asked Chris if he would consider teaming up with another shark, but Chris didn’t rank the other sharks for their skills in education.<\/p><p>\nThis led to an extended quarrel between Chris and Mark that Daymond seemed to enjoy witnessing. Kevin took advantage of the squabbling to change his offer, matching Chris’ for $400,000 at 4.85%.<\/p><p>\nMark joined the offers with $400,000 at 4%, the stake Dave initially had on the table. Daymond asked if Dave would consider more money for a higher stake, and Dave replied in the affirmative.<\/p><p>\nDave countered with $600,000 for 6% equity, and Chris countered that with a joint deal with him and Mark with $600,000 for 6.67%.<\/p><p>\nDave asked Mark if he’d match that, and Mark said he would. Dave accepted the deal, and shook hands with the two sharks, leaving the tank with two new partners.<\/p><p>\nNow let's check in for a Brightwheel update to see what happened after the episode aired.<\/p><p>\nBrightwheel has been thriving since appearing on Shark Tank. Mark and Chris were instrumental in the growth of the company, securing more investments and connections.<\/p><p>\nOur Brightwheel update research found that the company now has an estimated valuation of $600 million.

In a later interview, Sacca mentioned that he joined the Tank at Mark&#8217;s request, seizing the opportunity to &#8220;bust his balls on national television.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Sharks&#8217; friendship has served Brightwheel well, launching the app in even more schools nationwide. The premium features will include tweaks to the billing features, customizable access for parents and others, and expanded access to technical support, as well as the ability to manage multiple locations. Brightwheel&#8217;s future, with the help of Sharks Mark Cuban and Chris Sacca, looks bright.<\/p>\n<p>They raised even more money after the show. Cuban and Sacca invested an additional $10 million into the business in 2017. In 2018, they raised another $21 million from Mark Zuckerburg&#8217;s investment firm. In 2021, they raised $55 million from Addition, Emerson Collective, Next Play Ventures, Julia and Kevin Hartz and Daniel Shapero.<\/p>\n<h3>Update Segment<\/h3>\n<p>The business gets an on air update segment in season 9, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/shark-tank-season-9-episodes\/episode-908\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 908<\/a>. In the update, Dave says they&#8217;ve gone from 2500 schools using the app to over 25,000 globally. They also introduced a paid premium service that enables two way messaging in the app, let&#8217;s parents sign in from their own phone and adds document management for schools. In the segment, Dave, Mark and Chris meet with The Learning Care Group, the largest for profit child care provider in the USA. The Learning Group had been testing the app and they do a three year, million dollar deal. Sacca says this could end up being the biggest Shark Tank deal ever. Chris may be right, as of January, 2023, this business is valued at over $600 million.<\/p>\n<p>In April, 2023, Brightwheel acquired <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mothergoosetime.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Experience Early Learning<\/a>, a nationally recognized brand that produces a comprehensive research-based early education curriculum and assessment system,  for an undisclosed amount.

In September, 2020, MetLife Digital Accelerator powered by Techstars funded another $200,000. By 2021, they&#8217;ve helped students pay off over $10 million in debt.

On May, 1, 2024, ChangEd ran into some technical issues that irked users. The company&#8217;s banking partner, Synapse, was set to be acquired by Tabapay Inc. 9 days later, Tabapay backed out due to issues surrounding reconciliation of Synapse&#8217;s books. 2 days after that, Synapse&#8217;s banking partner, Evolve, said they were stopping Synapse&#8217;s ACH (Automatic Clearing House) functionality due to a disagreement about Evolve&#8217;s access to a dashboard that Synapse uses to monitor the flow of funds through accounts. This action locked ChangEd users from cashing out, making payments, making transfers and more.<\/p>\n<p>This set off a whole chain of events starting with the bankruptcy judge in the case asking Synapse to &#8220;prioritize unlocking access to funds for users.&#8221; The big issue is reconciling Synapse&#8217;s ledgers with their various partner banks. Throughout the entire month of June, 2024, there was a lot of legal wrangling, meetings, discussions and demands but still ChangEd customers had no access to their funds. On July4 , 2024, it was announced that a forensic accounting firm has been hired to assist in the reconciliation. The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are pressuring Evolve and other banks affected by the Synapse bankruptcy to release customer funds  The big issue is up to $96 million owed to companies like ChangEd is missing. As of July, 18, 2024, the issue remains unresolved.<\/p>\n<p>Shark Tank Blog will update this page as more information on ChangEd and Daniel Stelmach and Nick Skrzyniarz becomes available.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/changed\/"},"title":"ChangEd | S9"},"Monti Kids Montessori Toys":{"recap":{"recapLink":"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/monti-kids-update-shark-tank-season-10\/","recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/monti-kids-update-shark-tank-season-10\">Shark Tank Monti Kids Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>The company is still in operation and the deal did finalize with Kevin.

Daniel thinks they have a $100 million company on their hands.<\/p>\n<p>Rachel and Joe visit the first Yellow Leaf Hammocks retail store on a Virgin Cruise Ship. The cruise line likes the company&#8217;s purpose and that they empower women. There will be hammocks in every cabin on every ship, so over a million people a year can experience their hammocks. Joe says the retail shops on the Virgin line will help them reach $20 million in lifetime sales by the spring of 2023. The couple is overwhelmed by the impact Shark Tank has had on their business and the Thai community that weaves the hammocks. At the end of the update segment, the entire community screams &#8220;THANK YOU&#8221; to the camera.<\/p>\n<p>As of July, 2024, the company has $4.5 million in annual revenue.<\/p>\n<p>*editor&#8217;s note &#8211; one of my daughters gave us one of these hammocks for Christmas in 2021.

They issued this statement:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>“Those letters similarly disparaged these products and leave retailers, as well as the public, with the impression that products like our client’s have caused infant deaths. As Commissioner Trumka is aware, that impression is false.

Nonetheless, retailers’ responses to his admonishment were swift.<\/p>\n<p>Within days of receiving Commissioner Trumka’s letters the retailers, including Amazon, Target, Babylist, Nordstrom, Maisonette, and more, stopped selling weighted infant products, including Dreamland’s.<\/p>\n<p>Commissioner Trumka does not have the authority to use the weight of his office to effectuate a stop sale on products when he was not able to achieve even a notice of proposed rulemaking through the avenues provided for by law.<\/p>\n<p>As a result of Commissioner Trumka’s unlawful statements and actions, Dreamland has suffered tremendous financial losses.

To address safety, no adverse events were observed, the weighted blankets were never removed due to infant distress, and infants experienced no significant temperature change. To address feasibility, 94 percent of approached mothers were receptive to the use of weighted blankets and staff reported no obstacles to using the blanket.&#8221; Therefore, the study actually demonstrated safety, not risk.<\/li>\n<li>“Over the past 10+ years, Dreamland Baby and Nested Bean combined have sold over 3.5 million weighted sleep sacks and swaddles with NO evidence of a product hazard.”<\/li>\n<li>“The AAP, CPSC, NIH, CDC and others have only theorized that our products are unsafe,” Williams says. “They have provided no peer-reviewed, published, or scientific evidence of any kind demonstrating this product category is unsafe, has ANY connection to SIDS, or any other serious injury to babies.”<\/li>\n<li>The AAP “continued to push the lack of efficacy of weighted products.&#8221; But, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/100-percent-of-parents-got-more-sleep-thanks-to-dreamland-baby-weighted-sleep-sacks-301502855.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">2022 survey of 500 responses<\/a>, she shares that 90 percent of parents said it helped their baby feel calm.

The Dreamland suit alleges Dreamland&#8217;s products weren’t safe as advertised and that the company was in violation of state and federal consumer laws. The specific products cited in the suit include: Dream Weighted Sleep Sack, the Dream Weighted Sleep Swaddle, the Dream Weighted Transition Swaddle, the Bamboo Weighted Transition Swaddle and the Weighted Toddler Blanket. The suit also accuses Dreamland of false and misleading advertising with regards to its safety claims. The lawsuit demands that Dreamland Baby issue full refunds to all those joing the class.<\/p>\n<p>Shark Tank Blog will update this page with new news about Dreamland Baby and Tara Williams as new information becomes available.<\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/dreamland-baby\/"},"title":"Dreamland Baby | S11"},"Parting Stone Solidified Remains":{"recap":{"recapLink":"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/parting-stone-update-shark-tank-season-14\/","recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/parting-stone-update-shark-tank-season-14\"><strong>Shark Tank Parting Stone Update<\/strong><\/a><\/h2>\n<p>We have great news to share in our Parting Stone update!

In a few months after airing, Lim had to double his staff and office space to accommodate the flood of orders. The company did licensing deals with MGM, selling their products at six of MGM&#8217;s properties in Las Vegas. The pandemic hit this business hard. They were doing sales in the neighborhood of $15-$20 million going into 2020, then raves and other events ceased for over a year. In August, 2021, the company hd 50 full-time employees and 3,000 square feet of warehouse space. In January, 2023, they were forced to shut the business down. This statement appeared on the company Facebook page:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>To our customers &amp; community,<br \/>\nIn 2010 we started our business selling light gloves out of the trunk of a car. We wanted to create a company that embodied the magic we felt when giving and receiving light shows and share that with the entire world. We started as a small family business and were able to grow and see that vision come to life. It grew to something bigger than we ever thought it could be and we are eternally grateful for that. However, we&#8217;ve encountered more challenges than we ever anticipated. We never truly recovered from the gloving ban at major festivals in the early 2010s and after a global pandemic shutting down all gatherings from festivals to light show meet ups, we&#8217;ve faced devastating company losses. After much deliberation, we regret to inform you we&#8217;ve come to the difficult decision to close down EmazingLights.com.<br \/>\nThis journey would not have even been possible without you, our EMAZING customers and community. We are beyond grateful to have been a part of the light show movement. Thank you for supporting our vision, sharing your light shows, joining our competitions, and spreading joy at festivals, light art meet-ups, and beyond. Your support is what kept us going as long as we could and you&#8217;ve impacted our lives more than you could ever know.<br \/>\nWe know that the gloving and flow arts community is so much bigger than our brand and hope you all continue to spread the joy and love for it that inspired us to start this journey 12 years ago.<br \/>\nAll recent orders placed will still be fulfilled and our customer service team will still be available for any assistance.

To make a long story short, apparently Pittman &#8220;borrowed&#8221; the idea for the air mattresses from the holder of the patent, TruckBedz, and proceeded to copy not only their product, but their website and marketing strategy as well.

If he spent as much money and energy on product development and sales instead of &#8220;borrowing&#8221; ideas,  covering his tracks and hiring lawyers, maybe he would still have a viable business.

In April, 2023, Barzman pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about forged paintings he created and sold. He attributed the forged paintings to the late Jean-Michel Basquiat.

She revealed that she would make no profit that year whatsoever, and had made no profit at all from The Green Garmento. The sharks were stunned. Jennie tried to brush past, saying she was “just four years in” and it was too early to expect profits, but the sharks disagreed. How could a company generate $1 million in sales and see no return on investment? For the sharks, this was a massive red flag.<\/p><p>\nRobert asked how much money Jennie was losing, and Jennie said she was losing $10,000 per month. He asked how much she lost last year, and Jennie claimed that she didn’t know. She violated the Shark Tank cardinal rule– know thy numbers!<\/p><p>\nJennie continued peeling back layers, and revealed that she had invested $380,000 into her product, and also had taken on a collection of “non-equity investors.” The sharks were stunned again, and Mark asked what the investors got for their money if not equity.<\/p><p>\nJennie said that these investors were receiving 9% of all revenue off the top until their money was paid back. Mark asked how much money she took from these investors, and Jennie answered that she had accepted $900,000 from them.<\/p><p>\nKevin asked how much of the $900,000 Jennie had already paid back, and she said “not very much.” With the truth finally coming to light, the sharks would fall like dominoes. Robert went first, telling Jennie she had a great product, but he couldn’t see past the elephant in the room. For that reason, he was out.<\/p><p>\nBarbara left next, also applauding the product design, but stating she could not justify “buying into a problem.” Kevin would not go quietly, sharing the cold, hard truth about green products and claiming that everyone wants to save the world unless it costs them something. He said this was the reason why solar “doesn’t work,” wind “doesn’t work,” and why The Green Garmento “won’t work.” He was out.<\/p><p>\nMark left the tank with a lesson. He said that many investors followed her path, accruing debt under the assumption that more money would make their business successful. They, and Jennie, would learn the hard way that “debt is not your friend.” With that, Mark was out. The last shark remaining was Daymond, and he didn't remain long. He too was out.<\/p><p>\nWith no offers from the sharks, Jennie was forced to leave the tank without a deal. How did things go for Jennie after the pitch?

With help from the sharks, she's hoping to finally improve production, logistics, sales, and marketing.<\/p><p>\nFran's plan was to have an online and retail presence.

Kevin O'Leary, Daymond John, and Lori Greiner gracefully bowed out because they did not want to get into the drink space.<\/p><p>\nBarbara, however, saw something in Fran. She was impressed by Fran's undeniable sales charisma and pitch perfection. She offered $100,000 upfront with a $250,000 line of credit. But there was a catch.<\/p><p>\nShe wanted a 40% stake in the business.<\/p><p>\nFran thanked Barbara for the offer and shared that she had potential backing from two sports legends - an NFL and an NBA Hall of Famer.

Trew moved on to teach culinary arts at a Cincinnati area high school and also works as an independent chef. Corey remains with the company. Ultimately both men left the company in 2018. Trew is still a culinary instructor at Gilbert A.

New stores feature a rebranding where, instead of grilled cheese, they are offering &#8220;melts&#8221; to allow for more creative options. They also plan to use ovens to make the melts, cutting prep time from 6-7 minutes down to 90 seconds.  Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic put the expansion plans on hold.<\/p>\n<p>As of April, 2021, only seven stores remained open, some falling victim to Covid-19 related shutdowns. One of those stores is the new prototype store of the re-branded Tom &amp; Chee (the &#8220;+&#8221; was replaced). In June, 2021, the company opened new franchised stores in Cincinnati, Oklahoma City and Pittsburgh. In January, 2022, an Atlanta franchise store closed. By June, 2022, the company, under GSR&#8217;s guidance, is back offering franchises and plans on expansion with a &#8220;leaner&#8221; business model.<\/p>\n<p>As of June, 2023, there are 7 locations and the company is planning &#8220;rapid expansion&#8221; across the USA. One of the locations is a company owned &#8220;dual restaurant&#8221; concept where there is a Tom and Chee and a Gold Star location in the same building.

Andy is awaiting delivery of a piston ring. He made this announcement in a campaign update:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Lately I’ve received a number of questions as to whether the project has been abandoned. I can’t blame people for asking, but I’m glad to reassure you that the pump’s progress is alive and well, and needs very little to be delivered. Scrapping the pump was never a thought for me, and in fact would cost me more than completing it. Covid notwithstanding, most of the other delays reflect a cautious approach specifically to avoid the danger of a project-killing mistake. I’ve certainly made some mistakes, and being over-cautious is likely one of them, but thankfully none of them has put the project itself at risk, and the enthusiastic support from backers has ensured that it will go through.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In November, 2021, he finally received confirmation that the product works. In yet another IndieGoGo update, he says:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The factory and I have been wrestling with the piston-and tube combination for a few months now, and the latest piston-and-tube sample has come in. The result: Victory at last! It works!<\/p>\n<p>It’s always easy to test the pieces and declare “this doesn’t work,” but it’s much harder to know why it didn’t work, or what needs fixing. Even harder is understanding how the factory can accomplish the new fix. This problem was maddening to me, especially because it seemed like it should&#8217;ve been so simple. In this case, the piston ring had at least 3 changes in shape (mostly how and where it attaches) and two changes in material type; the piston tube had two corresponding minor shape changes; and the main tube, inside of which the piston moves up and down, had two as well. And now, finally, I can forget about all of them. Except this final one.<\/p>\n<p>As I’ve said before, this is the final piece I was waiting for. So now the big question… when does production start? Here goes: first, they need to send me one more sample. Why? Because the factory insists on a final sample of everything working together. The recent package included only the piston tube and sealing rings, not a full pump set, so testing requires a mix-and-match with prior samples. After a few revisions that creates the potential for error. For another, at this stage each component comes with a dated sign-off tag to approve the look, feel, function and overall quality of the part, and it just makes sense. If they insist on this step for their own quality control, I won’t buck that process. That said, there aren’t any design changes or problems to fix, so the turnaround time should be quicker than previous rounds.<\/p>\n<p>After that’s cleared, it will be two weeks for the factory to plan the staffing, the floor space, and to &#8220;tee-up&#8221; the inventory of raw plastic, and another 2-3 weeks to run the assembly line, including the packaging. From there it goes to shipping. Shipping from China is usually 3 weeks of freight time + US mail time; however, due to the current backlog in container shipping, I will probably drop-ship directly from China to save time. I will confirm those details once production starts.<\/p>\n<p>And that’s the update! No pictures this time, as the parts are still covered in peanut butter. But the next one should have a full set of unboxing pics!<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to write me directly or leave a comment on the board using the links below.

After I bugged and bugged them to deliver, on January 16<sup>th<\/sup> I got their email with a tracking number and a message: “We just sent the package, and you’ll get it in 5-10 days. It has less than what you’re expecting. Also, we’re closing from now until February 10<sup>th<\/sup> for the Chinese New Year.” I don’t like to complain about the factory, because good or bad the buck stops with me, not them. But I can’t hide my annoyance at getting a “here’s the minimum before we disappear on vacation” type of email. So I settled down to wait for the package. And when I got it, the frustration was fulfilled: instead of a few complete pumps, it had 4 production-quality piston rings.<\/p>\n<p>This is an example of getting not what I wanted, but only what was needed. As the final piece, it was necessary to receive and test the production units, instead of the one-offs from the last sample, before going forward. All other components have already been vetted. So I’m good to go. But I’m confused and annoyed by the factory’s behavior, and need a better understanding of their timeline. So that’s what’s coming up in the next few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>The main thing is to pin down the dates, and then the exact dimensions of size and weight for packaging. When I have firm dates, I’ll send them out.<\/p>\n<p>As always, thanks for supporting one of the nuttiest crowdfunding campaigns ever. Feel free to leave any comments or write me with questions using the links below. Best wishes,<\/p>\n<p>Andy<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>By July, 2022, he has still not delivered, but he&#8217;s getting closer. In an update to backers, he states &#8220;the pieces are in place for production.&#8221; In August, 2022, the production samples arrived and there were two problems that needed to be fixed before beginning actual productions. One problem was the factory gave him the wrong piston and the other was defective threads on the collar.<\/p>\n<p>In a June, 2023 update to his very patient backers, Andy says the factory is testing the piston for durability. In machine testing, the pistons cracked after 3000 pumps. A redesign got that up to 20,000 pumps and Andy&#8217;s factory has told him that once the testing is complete, the rest of the manufacturing process should go smoother. In the same update, he said he will have a production date &#8220;soon.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a May, 2024 update, Andy told his backers the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Backers,<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot to report today. As noted in the last update, factory tooling is on hold until more funds are raised. Accordingly, I&#8217;ve been making the rounds at local VC and investor clubs. It&#8217;s a slow turnaround affair. The good news is that I&#8217;ve gotten a number of opportunities to present it to potential investors, and a few have scheduled further discussions, which is a positive reaction even while it&#8217;s no guarantee. And until a commitment is made I have nothing to report. As they say, &#8220;a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,&#8221; and right now I have 3-4 &#8220;in the bush&#8221; without having one to bring home yet. I am confident one of them will come through, and I will be happy to report it to you all when that happens.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you to all who have written me with messages of kindness and encouragement. I appreciate them all.<\/p>\n<p>As always, you can write me or post a comment using the links below. Thank you again for your support.

In September, 2020, the International Trade Commission issued a General Exclusion Order for Final Straw which bars importing products that infringe on their patent.

Deliveries for the first Kickstarter campaign back in 2018 weren&#8217;t made either.<\/p>\n<p>While Cohen still lists the business as &#8220;open&#8221; on her LinkedIn profile, social media hasn&#8217;t been updated since 2021 and the website will not let you order anything.

In the update, Mitch, Barbara and a herd of Santas go to Bloomingdale&#8217;s in New York. The company is going to provide Santas to the flagship New York store. Barbara and Mitch meet with a store executive to &#8220;finalize the deal,&#8221; then they oversee Santa auditions. Mitch announces he did $1.4 million in sales in 2018.

There was also a &#8220;Santa shortage&#8221; in 2022 at Hire Santa as more companies and brands sought out Santa to appear at their functions. Demand exceeded supply and Hire Santa had to up its recruiting. Part of the reason for the Santa scarcity is some people left their Santa roles due to concerns over Covid.

The ballroom is decorated with Holiballs and there&#8217;s a Santa talking to a bunch of kids. All guests are bringing presents to donate to the less fortunate. Mitch is addressing a roomful of Santas saying they&#8217;ll be bringing joy to children. Barbara says Mitch is the hardest working guy she&#8217;s ever dealt with.

They can be found at Dave and Busters and Sky Zone and other venues. As of August, 2021, the company raised $19 million in crowdfunding, plus more money from Mark Cuban, to release the Omni One. They were supposed to release the home version in the second quarter of 2021, but it has not been released yet. In July, 2022, the company opened its 60th Omni Arena at Xtreme Action Park in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The Omni One is still available as a &#8220;pre-order&#8221; item at this time. Annual revenue is $9 million.<\/p>\n<p>As of June, 2023, the company has 70 Omni Arena locations and they&#8217;re shipping beta units to early investors. The company is still actively <a href=\"https:\/\/invest.virtuix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">crowdfunding<\/a> and claims to have a waiting list of over 35,000 customers.

In October, 2023, the home version is still on pre-order.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts About Virtuix Omni on Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/virtual-reality-virtuix-omni\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Reality Video Game Interface<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Company Information<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.virtuix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/VirtuixOmni\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/virtuixomni\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/virtuix-omni\/"},"title":"Virtuix Omni | S5"},"Beneath The Ink":{"recap":{"recapLink":"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/beneath-the-ink-ebook-links-update-shark-tank-season-6\/","recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/beneath-the-ink-ebook-links-update-shark-tank-season-6\/\">Shark Tank Beneath the Ink Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Our Beneath the Ink update is quite interesting because the company has completely refocused and rebranded since appearing on Shark Tank.

Beanstack is an online curriculum for helping with reading challenges. The restructuring of the company appears to have brought success, and the business continues to grow.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, they rolled out the Beanstack curriculum to their first library.

Some of our competitors reached out to us about this ahead of time, and we offered to pay their legal bills and help out anyway we could. The reason for this is, we live in Thailand where these pants come from. In Thai they&#8217;re referred to as &#8220;Elephant Pants&#8221;. These douchebags came to TH, took the name, went back to US and registered a similar trademark &#8220;The Elephant Pants&#8221; and attempted to threaten other domestic sellers of these pants with scare tactics. When they attempted to sue us, we refused to comply and told them we&#8217;d take it to court and would just waste money fighting the case. We would also attempt to get their trademark invalidated. It&#8217;s important for us that other domestic sellers can continue to sell using the words &#8220;Elephant Pants&#8221;. The funny thing is, out of respect to their business, we never actually used the terms &#8220;Elephant Pants&#8221; on our website before they sued us.

One of Muddy Water Camo's investors, Will Clark, who purchased a majority share, began operating a website called Muddy Water Outdoors. As of 2023, <a href=\"https:\/\/muddywateroutdoors.com\">Muddy Water Outdoors<\/a> remains in business, and annual revenue is estimated between $1 million and $2 million.

The exposure from the show helped land them a meeting with Louisiana&#8217;s governor, Phil Bryant. The pair enjoyed expanded support following the airing, expanding their sales and growing the company. Several large camo manufacturers approached them in hopes of landing a licensing deal.<\/p>\n<p>2015 might have brought muddied waters, however. A lawsuit is rumored to have been filed by Kirkpatrick against the other investors, with claims of being bilked out of his patent.

Muddy Water Camo may face rough sailing, if the owners can&#8217;t iron out their differences and learn to blend in.<\/p>\n<p>It appears the lawsuit may have been settled as there is nothing out there about it other than the initial filing. The company rebranded to Clear Image Camo in 2106 and that business is defunct as of 2019.

The social media is active and thriving, and the blog is regularly updated, all good signs of a healthy and growing company. The cricket-based protein bars have been a big hit with consumers interested in &#8220;green&#8221; eating choices, and several large retailers have expressed interest in the line as well. While crunching on crickets might not be everyone&#8217;s idea of a tasty snack, Chapul is hopping onto the scene as the next solution to the world&#8217;s need for cheap, renewable protein.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/shark-tank-season-7-episodes\/episode-716\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 716<\/a> in season 7, Chapul was the featured &#8220;update segment.&#8221; Pat tells the viewing audience &#8220;Chapul cricket bars are hopping off the shelf!&#8221; The product is in all 217 Sprouts stores; they are the first major retailer to carry insect bars. To date, they have $750K in sales and they&#8217;re on track for $1.5 million this year. Pat became a dad since he aired and he wants to continue to make the world a better place. Thanks to Mark and Shark Tank, it&#8217;s happening!<\/p>\n<p>In 2016, Daniel Lubetsky of Kind Bars fame invested an undisclosed amount in the business. This was long before he became a guest Shark. In 2019, Chapul got out of the protein bar business when his co-packer went out of business. The company now only sells the <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3AQMwN5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">cricket flour<\/a>. Pat is working with a group that helps new insect farming ventures in Indonesia get started.<\/p>\n<h3>Black Soldier Fly Farming<\/h3>\n<p>In February, 2022, the company raised an additional $2.5 million from Mark Cuban, Daniel Lubetzky and Nexus PMG. The funds will be used to  create and build the Chapul Farms’ Insect Innovation &amp; Research Center in McMinnville, Oregon. The facility will use black solider fly larvae to consume food waste and upcycle food to prevent it from ending up in landfills. The insects produce larvae, used in human food and animal food products as protein, and insect manure (frass), used as an alternative to synthetic fertilizers.<\/p>\n<p>Chapul gets an update segment in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/season-13-shark-tank-episodes\/episode-1320\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 1320<\/a>. In the segment, Pat says he was in over 500 stores with the bars, but he wasn&#8217;t getting people to buy again. Then he talks about the co-packer going out of business. Next, he talks about the new farm and how he came to meet Daniel Lubetzky. The company has $2 million in lifetime sales. The new farm will be ready in 2023 and will provide 70 jobs. Once operational, it should generate $20 million in sales per year.<\/p>\n<p>By November, 2022, the bigger picture became clear. The company is in the business of building insect farms. Chapul is, at this time, building seven of these farms which are in &#8220;the latter stages of development.&#8221; By March, 2023, the company farm was open in McMinnville, OR. Now, in addition to the  cricket flour, the company sells Black Soldier Fly meal, oil, live larvae and frass (poop) for use in pet food, chicken farming, aquaculture and as soil amendments. They also build insect farming facilities for others.<\/p>\n<p>In April, 2023, the company raised another $10 million in series A funding. They also signed an agreement with The Spiritwood Energy Park Association in Jamestown, ND to develop an insect farm there. It should be completed some time in 2024. The big picture is they plan to have 20 of these facilities nationwide by 2032. As of April, 2024, the company is generating revenue, but reliable numbers are unavailable.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts About Chapul on Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/cricket-energy-bars-chapul\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Cricket Energy Bars<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Chapul Information<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3AQMwN5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">BUY NOW on Amazon<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/chapul.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ChapulRevolution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/eatinsects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/chapul\/"},"title":"Chapul | S5"},"SENDaBALL":{"recap":{"recapLink":"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/send-a-ball-update-shark-tank-season-1\/","recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/send-a-ball-update-shark-tank-season-1\/\">Shark Tank Send a Ball Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>While Send a Ball didn't secure an investment on Shark Tank, their appearance on the show proved to be a big win.<\/p><p>\nThe national exposure they received after airing led to a significant increase in sales.

As of November, 2021, annual revenue is $6 million. In February, 2022, the company raised $20 million to bring their total venture investments to $35 million. Part of the funds will drive their entry into retail which should begin in Q1, 2023. As of August, 2022, they are projecting 2022 revenue in the neighborhood of $10 million. In 2023, they boast over 100,000 online customers. They are in Target, Costco, The Container Store and other small retailers nationwide. In October, 2023, the company was the 15th largest Shark Tank company in sales with lifetime sales of $160 million.<\/p>\n<h3>More Updates<\/h3>\n<p>The company gets an update segment in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/season-15-shark-tank-episodes\/episode-1509\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 1509<\/a>. In the update, they reiterate their mission of creating products that reduce plastic packaging. They tout Shopify, their online store platform which makes it easy to upload new products without being computer engineers. When their episode aired, they got more traffic than they could have imagined and their site never went down.<\/p>\n<p>Before Shark Tank, they were in business just 2 months with sales of $200,000. Since appearing, they have $170 million in sales (they made $10 million more since last October). They&#8217;re now in Costco, Target, Erewhon and they recently launched nationwide into Whole Foods. One of the best ways they attract new customers in retail is through their plastic swaps. They invite people to bring in their cleaning products to swap them for one of theirs that can be used forever.  Kevin made a video of him wearing all his single use plastic which they show onscreen. Kevin says there&#8217;s a whole generation of people who don&#8217;t want to use single use plastics and Blueland solved the problem. Blueland is now a brand.<\/p>\n<p>Shopify invited the Blueland folks to their offices to show them their latest features. Sarah says Shopify has been an asset to small businesses everywhere. She says without Shopify, they couldn&#8217;t have created a business at the speed they did. The platform allows their brand and mission to shine through. To date, they&#8217;ve eliminated over 1 billion single use plastic containers from the ocean and landfills and they&#8217;re just getting started. As of July, 2024, the company is valued at over $220 million.<\/p>\n<p>The Shark Tank Blog will follow-up on Blueland as <span id=\"IL_AD1\" class=\"IL_AD\">more details<\/span> become available.<\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/blueland\/"},"title":"Blueland | S11"},"Third Wave Water Makes Coffee Tastes Better":{"recap":{"recapLink":"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/third-wave-water-update-shark-tank-season-9\/","recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/third-wave-water-update-shark-tank-season-9\/\">Shark Tank Third Wave Water Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>At the time of this Third Wave Water update, the company is still in business and has three different variations of its water additive on its website.<\/p><p>\nOne is specifically for dark roast coffee, one for coffee and tea made in a coffee pot, and one for coffee and tea made in an espresso machine.<\/p><p>\nWhile the deal with Barbara on Shark Tank didn't materialize, Charles and Taylor maintained a positive relationship with her and continue to benefit from her network.

The result: Swimply saw a 4,000% increase in business.<\/p>\n<p>In May, 2021, the company was in 125 U.S. markets, two markets in Canada and five markets in Australia.

The department threatened fines for owners and Swimply is threatening to sue the state. The state backed down a few months later.<\/p>\n<p>In November, 2021, the company did a $40 million venture round from a slew of investors including one of the founders of AirBnB.

The company initially aired during the early stages of Covid-19 related lockdowns. Katey had a lot of inventory on hand in anticipation of the Shark Tank effect and she couldn&#8217;t sell it so they went direct to consumer with some success. Then, a Wal Mart buyer came calling. Katey re-branded to Frobet, a combo of frozen yogurt and sorbet, and she&#8217;s in 4300 Wal Mart stores! She&#8217;s also in Stop &amp; Shop and every Kroger store too. Before Shark Tank, she had $300,000 or so in sales. Now, she has over $1 million for the year and $15 million in committed purchase orders. This deal worked out well. In 2022, Lori predicts they&#8217;ll do over $20 million in sales.<\/p>\n<p>In June, 2022, the company got a $2.5 million line of credit from WSFS Bank to fuel its explosive growth. At the time the company secured the credit line, they were in over 8000 stores. In March, 2023, the company launched in Kroger stores. As a promotion to publicize the shelf placement, Frobet partnered with multi-platinum country music star Jimmie Allen to create Miss Angie&#8217;s Peach Cobbler Frobert. The recipe is based on one of Allen&#8217;s mother&#8217;s recipes and is exclusive to Kroger. 2022 sales were over $20 million and should continue to grow.<\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/frozen-farmer\/"},"title":"Frozen Farmer | S11"},"Better Bedder Bed Sheet Holder Belt":{"recap":{"recapLink":"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/the-better-bedder-update-shark-tank-season-12\/","recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/the-better-bedder-update-shark-tank-season-12\">Shark Tank The Better Bedder Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>In terms of a The Better Bedder update, the company did $157,000 in sales in just one day after appearing on Shark Tank!<\/p><p>\nLori also filmed an infomercial for the company and has helped it grow from $950,000 in lifetime sales to over $2 million.<\/p><p>\nWe've got even more good news!

A little under 50 of those emails were from interested investors. Since the Shark Tank aired in February of this year, I found the missing link from years before. I’ve gotten a CTO on board who’s helped facilitate and finance the new face and technology behind the new Cheekd. The newly launched dating app allows users to solve missed connections with a new technology that was not available when the patented Cheekd ideawas launched in 2010. It was only a matter of time and I’m thankful I didn’t take the Sharks advice to quit and move on. While the physical cards worked anywhere in the world and were a perfect way to break the ice, we found a few barriers; the main one being that our users were still quite intimidated to walk up and slip a card to a total stranger.  Looking into alternatives of ways we could change the platform, we discovered a way to make these IRL encounters much easier and less intimidating via a mobile solution. Previously, with the Cheek&#8217;d Version1, users would use a set of clever cards to introduce themselves to individuals they encounter in the offline world who sparked their interest. If the interest was mutual, the card recipients used the card’s unique code to reconnect easily with the person via a private online profile viewable at Cheekd.com.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The newly launched Cheekd reimagines online dating with a new app that makes missed connections obsolete. Cheekd uses a cross-platform low energy Bluetooth technology, which fosters hyper local engagement. The app connects people in real-time, versus virtual time. Connections begin in person; Cheekd helps you take the next step and continue the conversation online.<\/p>\n<p>Cheekd ensures you ‘Never Miss a Connection’; thanks to this new Bluetooth technology, the app works on the train; on a plane… anywhere—You’ll get an immediate notification if someone who meets your criteria is within 30 feet of you.  If you’re near a potential spark, Cheekd makes sure you know about it.

Alfred Pirri claimed Cheek stole the idea he made up in 2007. He claims he told his therapist about it who then told Cheek. That case was dismissed in April, 2018. The following year, in October, 2019, the same man sued Cheek for defamation. He claimed he was calling him &#8220;crazy&#8221; on social media. That case was dismissed in March, 2021 and Pirri was ordered to pay Cheek&#8217;s attorneys fees. As of November, 2023, the company is still operating with estimated revenues of $1 million per year.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts About Cheek&#8217;d on Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/dating-cards-cheekd\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Dating Cards<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Cheek&#8217;d Information<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cheekd.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cheekd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Cheekd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/cheekd\/"},"title":"Cheek'd | S5"},"2400 Expert SAT, ACT and College Prep":{"recap":{"recapLink":"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/2400-expert-sat-prep-update-shark-tank-season-7\/","recapBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/2400-expert-sat-prep-update-shark-tank-season-7\/\">Shark Tank 2400 Expert Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Research for our 2400 Expert update revealed good news!

After their Shark Tank debut, the pair experienced the famous &#8220;Shark Tank effect,&#8221; which sent their business rocketing skyward. With all 5 Sharks offering a deal, it was clear that Better Life was a success story waiting to happen.<\/p>\n<p>Since appearing on Shark Tank, and making a deal with Lori, the company has managed to double their manufacturing, added six new employees, and gained retail contracts with Meijer, Marianos, and some Target stores. Better Life is now available internationally, having gained market share in Bermuda, Canada, throughout the European Union, and even making inroads into Korea. The business has grown by 645%, and was named the 503rd Fastest Growing company in the US by Inc. Magazine.<\/p>\n<p>Not only has the company been raking in the green, it&#8217;s become greener in its operations as well. Two solar panel arrays were added to the manufacturing facility, and a new way of making the packaging means more post-consumer content is used in the production of the products. Lori had to fight her fellow Sharks for a bite of the Better Life company, and it seems she&#8217;s helped them get a healthy taste of success.<\/p>\n<p>In 2018, the company was acquired by Bissel, Inc for an undisclosed amount.

Accordingly, a consumer would need to drink more than four Poppi sodas in a day to realize any potential health benefits from its prebiotic fiber. However, even if a consumer were to do this, Poppi’s high sugar content would offset most, if not all, of these purported gut health claims.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A Poppi spokesperson said the company “stands behind our products and that it believes the lawsuit is baseless, and we will vigorously defend against these allegations.” Sometime around July, 2024, Poppi removed the term &#8220;gut healthy&#8221; from its packaging.<\/p>\n<p>Shark Tank Blog will update this page as new information on Poppi &amp; Stephen and Allison Ellsworth becomes available.<\/p>\n<p>***EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: I buy this for my daughter regularly.

The box itself is very heavy, so be prepared to have some help if you have trouble lifting things over 25 pounds. However, once it was all out of the box, it was pretty easy to assemble and put together.<\/p><p>\nThe instruction manual does a good job of explaining how to put the pieces together and connect them to a propane tank. We have a propane fireplace on our back porch, so we simply connected it to that.<\/p><p>\nYou can cook your pizza with propane, wood chips, or charcoal. We weren't prepared for the wood chips (next time), so we just did it with propane. There are a handful of <a href=\"https:\/\/bertello.com\/pages\/videos-1\">videos on the website<\/a> that you'll want to follow before you cook your pizza. I neglected to watch the videos and ran into a few hiccups. Mainly, we made the pizzas a little too big and didn't let the stone get hot enough.<\/p><p>\nFor reference, you'll want to let the stone sit in the oven for 30 minutes to heat up to around 700-900 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, for the pizza, you'll want to make it about the size of a personal pizza, not the size of one you'd get from the store. Thankfully, they only take a few minutes to cook so it's easy to quickly cook a couple of them.<\/p><p>\nSince we didn't make our own dough and simply bought some dough from the grocery store, we didn't quite have enough flour on the bottom of it and had a hard time transferring it from the pan to the stone in the oven. However, we were able to add some flour to the bottom of the second and third pizzas and the transfer was much smoother.<\/p><p>\nPortable Pizza Oven<\/p><p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bertello-Outdoor-Pizza-Black-Combo\/dp\/B08B5HZ3CN?tag=sharktankrecap-20\"> Bertello Outdoor Pizza Oven Black + Pizza Peel Combo <\/a><\/p><p>\n__<\/p><p>\nThe Bertello Outdoor Pizza Oven - Wood and Gas-Fired Outdoor Pizza Oven is the most affordable, high quality, portable, wood fire, charcoal, pellet, and gas outdoor pizza oven available.<\/p><p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bertello-Outdoor-Pizza-Black-Combo\/dp\/B08B5HZ3CN?tag=sharktankrecap-20\"> <img src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20500'%3E%3C\/svg%3E\" alt=\"Bertello Outdoor Pizza Oven Black + Pizza Peel Combo\" \/><img src=\"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41a5fQclVGL._SL500_.jpg\" alt=\"Bertello Outdoor Pizza Oven Black + Pizza Peel Combo\" \/> <\/a><\/p><p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bertello-Outdoor-Pizza-Black-Combo\/dp\/B08B5HZ3CN?tag=sharktankrecap-20\"> Check Price on Amazon <\/a><\/p><p>\nWe earn a commission if you make a purchase, at no additional cost to you.<\/p><p>\nOverall, my experience with the Bertello pizza oven was great!

The two companies entered into a distribution agreement in 2014 whereby Anthem would distribute the Under the Weather products online. Sales of Under the Weather products increased dramatically. Things went south in 2015 when Under the Weather increased its wholesale prices to Anthem to a point where Anthem couldn&#8217;t make a profit. It was at this time Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods began offering Under the Weather products online and in stores. Anthem also alleged Under the Weather infringed on its trademark SportPod™. Anthem further alleged that UTW was disparaging its products on social media. The court dismissed all the various counts Anthem alleged in 2018 except the breach of contract and trademark infringement claims. Anthem then demanded a jury trial and the case has either been settled or has been in limbo since.

The rebranding coincided with an investment from Patrick Schwarzenegger, son of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who later appeared on Shark Tank with his company, <a href=\"https:\/\/sharktankrecap.com\/mosh-update-season-15\/\">Mosh<\/a>.<\/p><p>\nOur Sunniva Super Coffee update found that the company expanded its product line to include creamers in 2019.

Forbes recognized the brothers in their prestigious 30 Under 30 list in 2019. By 2020, Kitu Life's sales had skyrocketed to $55 million.<\/p><p>\nThe company's investor pool gained star power with former NBA star Baron Davis joining, followed by celebrities Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod) and Jennifer Lopez.<\/p><p>\nIn 2021, Sunniva Super Coffee (Kitu Life) appointed Rosanna Godden, formerly the finance vice president at Whole Foods Market, as its chief financial officer.<\/p><p>\nThe company underwent a leadership change in 2022. Rosanna Godden departed her role as CFO, and Tyler Ricks, a seasoned executive with experience at major coffee and tea companies, was welcomed as the new CEO.<\/p><p>\nDespite the leadership shift, Sunniva Super Coffee maintained its impressive financial performance. The company projected sales of $97 million for 2021 and boasted a valuation of $400 million.<\/p><p>\nA critical factor in this success was a strategic partnership forged with Anheuser-Busch in late 2020.<\/p><p>\nThis deal granted Sunniva Super Coffee access to a vast distribution network, allowing them to place their products in major retailers like Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Target, and numerous convenience stores nationwide.<\/p><p>\nIn 2021, the company secured an additional $106 million in investment, pushing its valuation to a staggering $500 million.<\/p><p>\nWhile their products were only available in approximately 40% of U.S. retail outlets, Kitu Life had already established itself as the third-largest bottled coffee manufacturer in the country, trailing only Starbucks and Dunkin'.<\/p><p>\nThey brokered an Anheuser-Busch partnership, which promised to expand their reach further, potentially propelling them to the number one position.<\/p><p>\nIn April 2022, Sunniva Super Coffee's sales projection crossed the $100 million mark. In May, it announced a partnership with rapper Vanilla Ice to <a href=\"https:\/\/drinksupercoffee.com\/products\/coffee\/vanilla-super-coffee\/\">promote its new Vanilla Iced Latte flavor. <\/a><\/p><p>\nKitu Life is exploring an initial public offering (IPO) as a means to fuel global expansion.

In 2019, they introduced creamers and raised $25 million from venture capitalists, including Aaron Rogers&#8217; Rx3 Ventures, to fuel growth.

By 2021, they hired Rosanna Godden, former finance vice president at Whole Foods Market, as its chief financial officer. Godden left the company in early 2022 and Tyler Ricks became CEO. Ricks previously worked for Peet&#8217;s Coffee, Mighty Leaf Tea, and Lipton Tea. Sales in 2021 are projected at $97 million and the company is valued at $400 million.<\/p>\n<p>In late 2020, they inked a distribution partnership with Anheuser-Busch. This allowed them to get their product in to Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Target and thousands of convenience stores. In August, 2021, the company raised another $106 million at a $500 million valuation. The company&#8217;s products are currently available in only 40% of U.S. retail outlets, but that still makes them the third-largest manufacturer of bottled coffee in the USA behind Starbucks and Dunkin.

The Covid-19 pandemic saw a spike in sales as people wanted to garden while on lockdown.<\/p>\n<p>They no longer sell the $14.99 product. Now, they offer container gardens for $24.99, a family size garden for $79.99 and a 4&#215;8 raised bed garden (raised bed not included) for $99.99.  They also offer themed container garden bundles (3 container gardens) for $92.99. In 2020, they dropped all retail sales to focus strictly on eCommerce. They also switched from the smaller gardens to larger sheets for raised bed gardens. The new layouts let customers customize what they want in their gardens. As of August, 2023, the company is in business and earning $5 million in annual revenue. In May, 2024, they started offering cannabis kits since the 2018 farm bill allows for the legal sale of cannabis seeds.
