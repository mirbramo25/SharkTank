The exposure the company received was worth dealing with the cutthroat Sharks. Chocomize continues to grow and expand into new markets. It&#8217;s become a popular product for parties, particularly for weddings. Joe&#8217;s sweet tooth and continued hard work serve him well, and he&#8217;s taking Chocomize to a successfully sweet level. Joe left the company in 2014 and is now a real estate investor and trader.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, the company continued to add to the product line. They now sell customized candies, mints, truffles toffee and more with a focus on corporate gifting and wedding favors.

NOHBO got off to a strong start with Mark&#8217;s support but ran into some shipping delays and other challenges along the way. In early 2016, there were a number of comments on the social media pages from disappointed customers who claimed the balls did not hold their shape. Shipping delays were another common concern.<\/p>\n<p>Things were looking up for Benjamin in August when Governor Rick Scott of Florida awarded Benjamin with the Young Entrepreneur Award, saying &#8220;I look forward to seeing NOHBO continue to grow here in Florida.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>With a Shark <em>and<\/em> a governor on his side, it seems as if Benjamin can&#8217;t help but prosper. His future plans include expanding his line of personal care products and improving the NOHBO balls themselves before licensing the idea out to major shampoo and conditioner companies. It&#8217;s too soon to tell if NOHBO will be a hit. Benjamin may be a bit wet behind the ears at 17, but his determination and innovation will serve him well going forward.<\/p>\n<h3>Making Changes<\/h3>\n<p>In 2018, Stern pivoted and stopped using the powdered form of balls. There were too many problems. He teamed with a chemist closer to his Melbourne, Florida headquarters, switched to a gel format and re-branded the product NOHBO Drops. As of March, 2020, Stern has 76 million purchase orders scheduled for the next four years in Europe and he just closed a $3.5 million round of venture funding. NOHBO gets an update segment in season eleven, episode 1115.<\/p>\n<p>In the update, he tours his factory and reveals another round of funding. Mark thinks it could be a $100 million company in the next few years.<\/p>\n<p>In May, 2022, Stern rolled out his own consumer brand called <a href=\"https:\/\/sunrisesession.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Sunrise Session<\/a> which features NOHBO like products. The business won the People&#8217;s Choice Award at the New York Society of Cosmetic Chemists Suppliers’ Day 2022 in New York City. As of November, 2022, Stern has licensed his technology to over 60 companies. In 2023, the company introduced Hydrofill &#8220;multi-dose water-soluble pods that contain an anhydrous hyper-concentrated base.&#8221; When the Hydrofill is added to a bottle of water and shaken, a standard-sized personal care product is generated.&#8221; Hydrofill products include shampoo, conditioner, body wash, face wash and shaving cream<\/p>\n<p>In January, 2023, the company announced it was joining the B Corp Beauty Coalition. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pr.com\/press-release\/876922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">press release<\/a>, it states the B Corp Beauty Coalition is &#8220;an organization that focuses on improving the sustainability standards of the cosmetic and beauty industries.

In the four years since the business began, Gadlin drew 18,794 custom cats for people through his website. He also sold cat tee shirts and other novelty items. Steve&#8217;s business was featured in an update segment in episode 315 in season three and he already paid Mark Cuban back, had several employees, and was suffering from severe writer&#8217;s cramp!<\/p>\n<p>In January of 2015, Gadlin announced that he was closing his cat-drawing  business in favor of focusing on his new television show, Steve Gadlin&#8217;s Star Makers, airing on WCIU-TV. His website and social media, however, show that Gadlin is still drawing cats for enthusiasts who request them, so it&#8217;s possible that the business isn&#8217;t quite as dead as he implied. Cats do, after all, have nine lives.<\/p>\n<p>In June, 2021, Steve re-launched the business, drawing cats for $9.95 &#8211; the same price as when he was on Shark Tank originally. He&#8217;s done over 21,000 cat drawings.

Considering that in 2021, College Hunks has over 160 franchisees and over $200 million in annual revenue, they&#8217;d be giving up serious change!<\/p>\n<p>In July, 2021, the company made this announcement in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.franchising.com\/news\/20210722_college_hunks_hauling_junk__moving_partners_with_susquehanna_private_capita.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">press release<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The purpose-driven, values-based, socially conscious, tech-enabled national moving and junk removal franchise College HUNKS Hauling Junk &amp; Moving® recently accepted minority investments from Susquehanna Private Capital (Susquehanna) along with two former International Franchise Association (IFA) Chairs- David Barr and Shelly Sun.<\/p>\n<p>Advised by Arlington Capital Advisors, Co-Founders and Visionaries Omar Soliman and Nick Friedman remain as head hunks. While terms of the agreement are undisclosed, the new investors will play roles on the board and help guide the future growth of the company. The two founders famously turned down a deal from Robert Herjavec on the very first episode of ABC&#8217;s Shark Tank ten years ago. Since then, Soliman and Friedman have led a successful brand that capitalizes on disrupting the local moving and junk hauling industries with a focus on building leaders and stress-free client experiences. College HUNKS Hauling Junk &amp; Moving now has over 160 franchises in the USA and Canada and is on pace to reach over $200M systemwide sales this year, nearly a 70% increase from 2020.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As of September, 2022, annual revenue of College Hunks Hauling Junk is north of $180 million.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts about College Foxes Packing Boxes on Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/college-foxes-packing-boxes-shark-tank-review\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">College Foxes Review<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>College Foxes Packing Boxes Company Information<\/h2>\n<p><a title=\"College Hunks Hauling Junk\" href=\"http:\/\/collegehunksfranchise.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"College Hunks Hauling Junk on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CollegeHunksHaulingJunk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"College Hunks Hauling Junk on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/collegehunks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/college-foxes-packing-boxes\/"},"Toygaroo":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/toygaroo\/\">ToyGaroo Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Although the Sharks were confident in the business model, ToyGaroo went out of business less than a year after the episode aired.

I failed a lot of people and I&#8217;m working to rectify our mistakes so they never happen again. We stopped operations in the marketplace some weeks ago to address these issues. Our goal is to re-emerge in the new year with a better website, a better business model and a better way of serving the thousands of customers worldwide that have helped Zuvaa get where we are. Zuvaa is a young company with a big vision. We have barely scratched the surface on this opportunity. The continent is vast and we can&#8217;t wait to show you all the beautiful artistry coming out of Africa. But in the interim, we need to fix our operations, grow our team and make sure we are providing the best experiences for you and the community in general. Can you help us?

The contents of the record setting board were donated to <a href=\"https:\/\/thelordsplace.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">The Lord&#8217;s Place<\/a>,  an organization that helps the homeless in Palm Beach county, Florida. The company continues to bring out new products including a baked brie board, dessert boards, vegan and gluten free options and more. As of November, 2023, they are doing $15 million in annual revenue.<\/p>\n<h3>Update Segment<\/h3>\n<p>The company gets an update segment in season 15, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/season-15-shark-tank-episodes\/episode-1504\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 1504<\/a>. In the update, Aaron and Rachel say they are the only company that ships cheese and charcuterie boards nationwide. When they started, they were selling through other third party vendors online; the product was selling well, but they needed to be able to sell through their own website to connect with their customers and understand what they want. Now, 95% of their sales are through their own website.<\/p>\n<p>Lori says she&#8217;s helped Boarderie scale and given them great marketing advice. She also introduced them to better cheese purveyors and given them entry into her social media world with millions of followers. Before Shark Tank, the company had $3.3 million in sales. In the 10 months since appearing, they&#8217;ve done $15 million in sales. They have 60 employees and plan to get an additional 15,000 square feet of production space to double their capacity. There&#8217;s a clip of the aforementioned record breaking charcuterie board and how they donated the food to a non-profit that works with the homeless. The update segment ends with Lori addressing the entire company by video.<\/p>\n<p>As of July, 2024, the company will nearly double their shipments this year and they&#8217;re projecting $61 million in revenue by year&#8217;s end.<\/p>\n<p>The Shark Tank Blog will follow-up on Boarderie &amp; Aaron Menitoff and Rachel Solomon as <span id=\"IL_AD1\" class=\"IL_AD\">more details<\/span> become available.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>***Editor&#8217;s Note: We ordered one of these last Christmas and it was OFF.

Just about one year after airing on the 2017 Holiday Special, we&#8217;ll see how far they&#8217;ve come. In the update they reveal they did $20 million in sales for the year.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/entertainment\/tv\/2019\/10\/10\/shark-tank-exclusive-new-list-20-best-selling-products\/3841699002\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">USA Today<\/a>, they were the fifth largest earning company in Shark Tank history with lifetime sales of $150 million. Apparently, they spend a lot of time suing to defend their patents. In February, 2020, the company appeared in The Shark Tank <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank-greatest-of-all-time\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Greatest of All Time Special<\/a> in the &#8220;greatest money makers&#8221; segment. Over the years, they did licensing deals with Marvel, Disney and some colleges. Apparently, the Covid-19 pandemic saw a spike in sales since, as Michael says, &#8220;it&#8217;s the ultimate work-from-home uniform.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>Trouble Brewing<\/h3>\n<p>In the spring of 2021, Brian appeared on HGTV&#8217;s Self Made Mansions. Feb. 20, 2021 was declared the first National Comfy Day. 2021 was not a good year for the business. Supply chain issues and some mismanagement pushed the company to the brink of bankruptcy. In June, 2021, Michael bought out Brian and Barbara&#8217;s shares as neither of them wanted to assume more risk.  Later in 2021, they were unable to get product from their Chinese factory in time for the 2021 holiday season due to increased customs bond costs.<\/p>\n<p>In February, 2022, the company fired their CEO. In March, 2022, the company&#8217;s now former CEO, Susan Hudson, sued the business for breach of employment agreement and promissory fraud, allegations the brothers deny. They claim they fired her because she spent too much on advertising, contributing to the company&#8217;s financial woes. Hudson claims she secured financing for the business to cover its bond costs in exchange for an equity stake. She claims the company&#8217;s financial woes are due to Barbara, Michael and Brian taking too much cash out, leaving the business cash strapped. The case is set to go to trial in September, 2023. The 2023 season will see Disney and college licensed Comfies on the market.<\/p>\n<h3>Going it Alone<\/h3>\n<p>In June, 2022, Michael bought out Brian and Barbera for an undisclosed amount. As of August, 2022, the company is still in business and doing around $15 million in annual sales. Lifetime sales, per Barbara Corcoran on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/season-14-shark-tank-episodes\/shark-tank-live-season-14-premiere\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Shark Tank Live<\/a> in September 2022, are over $400,000,000. Michael is seeking a buyer for the company as of February, 2023, and he&#8217;s determined to keep the company afloat whatever it takes. As of July, 2023 the company is still in business and awaiting the civil trial date.<\/p>\n<p>In October, 2023, the Comfy was listed as one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/top-15-shark-tank-businesses\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Top 15 Shark Tank Businesses<\/a>, coming in at number 6 with $550 million in lifetime sales.

In the update, Daymond and Bubba discuss the company&#8217;s burgeoning sales, $16 million to date!<\/p>\n<p>In October, 2019, Bubba closed his restaurant after 13 years in business. That&#8217;s as long as he played football. The ribs are still available to order from the company website. He also has products in 3000 or so grocery stores and he did a 1 million pound order with Hardee&#8217;s\/Carl&#8217;s Junior restaurants for a limited edition pork rib sandwich.<\/p>\n<p>The Covid-19 pandemic hurt sales and there was trouble behind the scenes. In May, 2023, Bubba revealed to an LA Times reporter he felt cheated by Daymond and the producers of Shark Tank. He claims he only recieved a little over $600,000 touted in the season 8 update. He also revealed the Daymond introduced him to Nate Holzapfel from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/mission-belt\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Mission Belt<\/a>. Nate helped the Bakers set up an eCommerce site to sell their products online and they did $250,000 in sales on show night. Nate, who&#8217;s since been indicted for multiple fraud counts, sexual harrassment and othe charges, controlled the business bank account and, when the Bakers terminated that arrangement, he closed up shop and sent them a check for just $8000.<\/p>\n<h3>More Trouble<\/h3>\n<p>In 2015, Bubba secured a licensing\/co-packing deal with Rastelli Foods Group.; The deal would give the Bakers 45% of sales revenue. The Bakers claim Daymond injected himself into the deal and the new terms were the Bakers got 45% of  sales, Rastelli got 35% and Daymond got 20%. After several $20,000 to $25,000 payments, the payments dwindled and both Daymond and Rastelli ceased communications with the Bakers. The Baker family also alleges the Carl&#8217;s Jr. deal, worth $5.8 million, only netted them $2,900 in net profits and a $61,917.45 licensing fee.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, Rastelli Foods sued the Bakers claiming they weren&#8217;t being forthright about the joint venture&#8217;s finances. The case was settled and Rastelli agreed to pay the Bakers $100,000 in installments. When the Bubba&#8217;s ribs business was sold, the installment payments dwindled. The Bakers, who were $170,000 in debt due to legal fees, were forced to shutter their business and sell their home (at a loss).<\/p>\n<p>After this story broke in May, 2023, Daymond sought a temporary restraining order against the Bakers. In a statement issued by Daymod&#8217;s spokesperson, it said the &#8220;temporary restraining order is due to the Bakers&#8217; blatant actions to undermine a business partnership and the legal parameters they agreed to four years ago. Their belief that they can unwind poor business decisions through slanderous social media posts and articles will no longer be tolerated.&#8221; Daymond himself called the accusations by the Bakers a &#8220;false narrative.&#8221; As of May, 2023, the ribs are still for sale on the company website. They are no longer available in stores.<\/p>\n<p>In July, 2023, both Daymond and Rastelli Foods obtained a permanent injunction against the Bakers, making the temporary restraining order permanent. The Bakers were ordered by the judge in the case to cease making any disparaging comments about Daymond and to remove all negative social media posts. By May, 2024, the website is down as is social media. It appears that they have gone out of business.

We shut down the production, and sold the last of it to our distributors and outlet stores at a discount. $8m in sales over 6-7 years (a few years we struggled with manufacturing) was an accomplishment for a high priced product with less capital than all our competitors.<\/p>\n<p>We launched our line in nearly 4k stores including Target, Whole Foods and Sprouts nationally, 3 regions of Albertsons, 4 regions of Costco, and many more.<\/p>\n<p>After 10 years, we put the line of our smoothies on hold indefinitely due to several core issues with the business model and supply chain. It became literally impossible to operate the smoothies with crushing amounts of cash needed to make it and the money wasn’t coming in fast enough.<\/p>\n<p>It didn’t make sense to continue losing money out of “pride” “passion” or “ego” and other things that founders have when it comes to their product.<\/p>\n<p>We pivoted to a shot line which has been easier and more sustainable but still difficult.<\/p>\n<p>The CPG winter is here. More companies are running out of capital than ever before. Rising costs, not able to raise money, margin crushing distributor fees and retailer promotions, and no exit in sight, this business is not what it used to be.<\/p>\n<p>My message to all the founders, cut everything possible unless it is VITAL to your business.<\/p>\n<p>I know you want to be decent, nice, reasonable people that don’t let others down. But if you need to let someone go to save capital and ensure the survival of your business, do it.<\/p>\n<p>If you pay a team $10k a month to check store shelves for you and you aren’t seeing that level of increase of sales to pay their bill, probably best to put them on hold.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a VP of sales for west and another for east and you can have one person handle the entire country, best to make this change and consolidate.<\/p>\n<p>This post isn’t to tell you to fire people, it’s to conserve capital as much as possible to ride out the storm and SURVIVE.<\/p>\n<p>This is from the founder’s lens, one owner to another.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/genius-juice\/"},"180 Cup":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/180-cup\/\">180 Cup Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Daymond John was quick to renege on his original offer, but that didn&#8217;t stop him from re-entering the arena and finally taking a bite out of the 180 Cup company.

A snippet of the Twitter exchange follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>ScottEvest: <\/strong>@<b>mcuban<\/b>#<b>Levi<\/b>&#8216;s received patent on rivet making Levi&#8217;s what it is today.

The only thing missing is the Marty McFly self sizing option!<\/p>\n<p>Scott Jordan continued to be a bombastic personality. In 2017, he was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/scott-jordan-opens-mouth-inserts-foot\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">forced to step down as CEO<\/a> because he called Fox News viewers &#8220;fucking idiots.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, he took back control of the company because the bank called a $2 million loan. The loan was for ad spending for TV spots. Apparently, the ad team wasn&#8217;t tracking the effectiveness of the ads and just kept throwing money at it, resulting in racking up the $2 million. Jordan covered the loan and retook control of the company. During the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, sales dropped by 50% and Scott did a series of livestreams with his mother in law to talk about traveling. As of April, 2023, the company&#8217;s annual revenue is $3 million.

In December, 2019, the company took in another $10 million from the same firms and others. Like a lot of companies, Lovepop pivoted during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. They converted some of their manufacturing machinery to produce face shields.<\/p>\n<p>In June, 2021, the company named Lisa Scopa as their new CEO. She will oversee a business that employs 800 people and does over $40 million in yearly sales. Also in 2021, the company opened six brick and mortar stores in Boston, California and Florida. Three more stores are slated for New York City in 2022. They also sell cards in hundreds of independent retailers world wide. By September, 2022, annual revenue is over $150 million.<\/p>\n<h3>Trouble Brewing<\/h3>\n<p>In January, 2023, the company raised another $5 million. $3 million was from the conversion of outstanding convertible securities and $2 million was new investment. In October, 2023, the company was the number 9 most successful Shark Tank company with $304 million in lifetime sales. In late April, 2024, the company sued 2 rivals in Federal Court in Colorado and New York, both for patent, copyright, and trademark infringement. The Colorado case involves Poplife, LLC and the New York case involves Paper Love,  LLC.<\/p>\n<p>In the Poplife case, LovePop contends the defendant is infringing on the patent for the technology that allows the cards to be three-dimensional. LovePop also claims copyright infringement for specific card designs. Their trademark infringement claims are based on the fact that Poplife&#8217;s logo is misleadingly similar to LovePop&#8217;s. The Paperlove case involves patent infringement on the pop up card technology. As of July, 2024, neither case has progressed beyond the filings.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts About Lovepop on Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/pop-up-greeting-cards-love-pop\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Pop Up Greeting Cards<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Lovepop Company Information<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3qDy1rX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">BUY NOW<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lovepopcards.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lovepopcards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lovepop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/lovepop\/"},"Copa Di Vino":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/copa-di-vino-2\/\">Copa di Vino Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Copa di Vino apparently is doing just fine without the Sharks.

On May, 1, 2024, ChangEd ran into some technical issues that irked users. The company&#8217;s banking partner, Synapse, was set to be acquired by Tabapay Inc. 9 days later, Tabapay backed out due to issues surrounding reconciliation of Synapse&#8217;s books. 2 days after that, Synapse&#8217;s banking partner, Evolve, said they were stopping Synapse&#8217;s ACH (Automatic Clearing House) functionality due to a disagreement about Evolve&#8217;s access to a dashboard that Synapse uses to monitor the flow of funds through accounts. This action locked ChangEd users from cashing out, making payments, making transfers and more.<\/p>\n<p>This set off a whole chain of events starting with the bankruptcy judge in the case asking Synapse to &#8220;prioritize unlocking access to funds for users.&#8221; The big issue is reconciling Synapse&#8217;s ledgers with their various partner banks. Throughout the entire month of June, 2024, there was a lot of legal wrangling, meetings, discussions and demands but still ChangEd customers had no access to their funds. On July4 , 2024, it was announced that a forensic accounting firm has been hired to assist in the reconciliation. The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. are pressuring Evolve and other banks affected by the Synapse bankruptcy to release customer funds  The big issue is up to $96 million owed to companies like ChangEd is missing. As of July, 18, 2024, the issue remains unresolved.<\/p>\n<p>Shark Tank Blog will update this page as more information on ChangEd and Daniel Stelmach and Nick Skrzyniarz becomes available.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/changed\/"},"Monti Kids Montessori Toys":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/montikids\/\">MontiKids Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>The deal with MontiKids closed and it&#8217;s listed as one of O&#8217;Leary&#8217;s investments on his website.

He thinks they&#8217;ll do hundreds of millions of dollars in sales in the next few years. Kevin and Nirav are present at the very first Hello Pre-Nup sponsored wedding where Kevin officiates.

Richard Trumka, the head of the Consumer Products Safety Commission issued a warning to retailers about weighted blankets in April, 2024, and many of them, including Amazon and Target, pulled the products off store shelves. In May, 2024, Tara Williams filed suit against the Consumer Products Safety Commission for their “illegal efforts” to ban the product’s sales. In addition, the New Civil Liberties Alliances, on behalf of Dreamland Baby,  planned to sue Richard Trumka, the head of the Consumer Products Safety Commission. They issued this statement:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>“Those letters similarly disparaged these products and leave retailers, as well as the public, with the impression that products like our client’s have caused infant deaths. As Commissioner Trumka is aware, that impression is false. His statements are laced with misrepresentations and deceitful language and imagery about the safety of weighted sleep products like Dreamland’s. Nonetheless, retailers’ responses to his admonishment were swift.<\/p>\n<p>Within days of receiving Commissioner Trumka’s letters the retailers, including Amazon, Target, Babylist, Nordstrom, Maisonette, and more, stopped selling weighted infant products, including Dreamland’s.<\/p>\n<p>Commissioner Trumka does not have the authority to use the weight of his office to effectuate a stop sale on products when he was not able to achieve even a notice of proposed rulemaking through the avenues provided for by law.<\/p>\n<p>As a result of Commissioner Trumka’s unlawful statements and actions, Dreamland has suffered tremendous financial losses. In fact, one retailer has stopped the sale of all of Dreamland’s products, not just its weighted products.”<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Dreamland Response<\/h3>\n<p>Tara Williams responded to the actions of the Consumer Products Safety Commission; she issued this statement to <a href=\"https:\/\/sleepopolis.com\/news\/dreamland-sues-weighted-blankets-controversy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Sleepopolis<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The AAP’s 2022 recommendations against the sleep sacks “imply a demonstrated evidence of a lack of safety,” she says, yet they only reference <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32868588\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">one study<\/a>, which concludes in its results: “A total of 16 patients were enrolled for a total of 67 weighted blanket sessions. To address safety, no adverse events were observed, the weighted blankets were never removed due to infant distress, and infants experienced no significant temperature change. To address feasibility, 94 percent of approached mothers were receptive to the use of weighted blankets and staff reported no obstacles to using the blanket.&#8221; Therefore, the study actually demonstrated safety, not risk.<\/li>\n<li>“Over the past 10+ years, Dreamland Baby and Nested Bean combined have sold over 3.5 million weighted sleep sacks and swaddles with NO evidence of a product hazard.”<\/li>\n<li>“The AAP, CPSC, NIH, CDC and others have only theorized that our products are unsafe,” Williams says. “They have provided no peer-reviewed, published, or scientific evidence of any kind demonstrating this product category is unsafe, has ANY connection to SIDS, or any other serious injury to babies.”<\/li>\n<li>The AAP “continued to push the lack of efficacy of weighted products.&#8221; But, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/100-percent-of-parents-got-more-sleep-thanks-to-dreamland-baby-weighted-sleep-sacks-301502855.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">2022 survey of 500 responses<\/a>, she shares that 90 percent of parents said it helped their baby feel calm.

The specific products cited in the suit include: Dream Weighted Sleep Sack, the Dream Weighted Sleep Swaddle, the Dream Weighted Transition Swaddle, the Bamboo Weighted Transition Swaddle and the Weighted Toddler Blanket. The suit also accuses Dreamland of false and misleading advertising with regards to its safety claims. The lawsuit demands that Dreamland Baby issue full refunds to all those joing the class.<\/p>\n<p>Shark Tank Blog will update this page with new news about Dreamland Baby and Tara Williams as new information becomes available.<\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/dreamland-baby\/"},"Parting Stone Solidified Remains":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/parting-stone\/\">Parting Stone Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>This deal closed quickly and Justin did raise the prices from when he taped the show.

It was later revealed that Mark backed out andd Barbara invested a smaller amount than the deal they made on air. Since their original air date, they&#8217;ve received over 9,000 requests for franchises and they&#8217;re opening new stores all over the country. Tom and Chee has an update segment airing on January 17 in episode 514.<\/p>\n<p>In the summer of 2014, Tom and Chee laid off 6 employees at their corporate headquarters in Cincinnati. The reason for layoffs of members of their marketing, catering and training teams was to position the company for future growth. A few days after the layoffs, the company announced it will open 13 new franchises in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Tennessee, Missouri, Kansas, North Carolina, Louisiana, Georgia and Nebraska. The plan for 2015 includes 30 new stores. The company claims to have 170 stores under contract.<\/p>\n<p>Tom and Chee has a second update segment in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/shark-tank-season-6-episodes\/episode-616\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 616<\/a> in season six, where they&#8217;ll likely announce their new locations to Shark Tank Nation. In this update, they reveal they&#8217;ve grossed over $14 million since appearing on Shark Tank. They explain Barbara has been instrumental in finding real estate. They have 19 locations now, but they&#8217;re going world-wide. Tom and Chee will surely have another update segment!<\/p>\n<p>Yet another update occurs in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/shark-tank-season-8-episodes\/episode-814\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 815<\/a>! In this update, they are expanding again. Unfortunately, their expansion went too fast and the fledgling franchise outfit didn&#8217;t have the proper supports in place. They also had a lot of franchisees that didn&#8217;t have food service experience. Shortly after this update, the company&#8217;s assets were seized by their bank.<\/p>\n<p>In October, 2017, the business assets were acquired from the bank by GSR Brands, the parent company of Cincinnati&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goldstarchili.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Gold Star Chili<\/a> for an undisclosed amount. Trew Quackenbush and Corey Ward were still involved with the company  when it was acquired: Trew worked on the menus and Corey on marketing. Trew moved on to teach culinary arts at a Cincinnati area high school and also works as an independent chef. Corey remains with the company. Ultimately both men left the company in 2018. Trew is still a culinary instructor at Gilbert A. Dater High School and Corey is an independent contactor working in apparel design.<\/p>\n<p>GSR determined the franchise operation grew too quickly without the infrastructure to support it. When GSR acquired the business, there were 23 stores in operation (down from a high of 35). As of 2019, there were a dozen still open.<\/p>\n<p>In 2020, GSR began the process of opening more stores. New stores feature a rebranding where, instead of grilled cheese, they are offering &#8220;melts&#8221; to allow for more creative options. They also plan to use ovens to make the melts, cutting prep time from 6-7 minutes down to 90 seconds.  Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic put the expansion plans on hold.<\/p>\n<p>As of April, 2021, only seven stores remained open, some falling victim to Covid-19 related shutdowns. One of those stores is the new prototype store of the re-branded Tom &amp; Chee (the &#8220;+&#8221; was replaced). In June, 2021, the company opened new franchised stores in Cincinnati, Oklahoma City and Pittsburgh. In January, 2022, an Atlanta franchise store closed. By June, 2022, the company, under GSR&#8217;s guidance, is back offering franchises and plans on expansion with a &#8220;leaner&#8221; business model.<\/p>\n<p>As of June, 2023, there are 7 locations and the company is planning &#8220;rapid expansion&#8221; across the USA. One of the locations is a company owned &#8220;dual restaurant&#8221; concept where there is a Tom and Chee and a Gold Star location in the same building. As of June, 2024, they still have 7 locations.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts about Tom and Chee on Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/gourmet-grilled-cheese-shops\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Gourmet Grilled Cheese Shops<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Tom and Chee Information<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.tomandchee.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/4TomAndChee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TomAndChee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/tom-and-chee\/"},"LiddUp Cooler With Lights":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/liddup\/\">Liddup Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes hesitation costs bigtime in the Shark Tank, but at other times it can be the right move.

Liberty Bottleworks manufactures 100-percent recycled aluminum bottles and Zach Crain used one during his Shark Tank pitch. This prompted Liberty&#8217;s owner, Tim Andis, to give Zach a call. Freaker now creates proprietary covers for all Liberty&#8217;s bottles.  Freakers are available on Amazon, the <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3faaj25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Freaker<\/a> website, and the Liberty Bottleworks website.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, a little over a year later, the partnership between Liberty Bottleworks and Freaker has dissolved. According to the folks at Freaker, the Liberty Bottleworks folks started selling knock-off Freakers and the relationship was terminated.<\/p>\n<p>In early 2015, Freaker set out to make Freaker Feet &#8211; funky socks to match the Freaker designs. In March, 2015, my wife and daughter visited Freaker&#8217;s &#8220;world HQ&#8221; in Wilmington, NC. Zak was meeting with the sock factory people at the time, but an assistant let us tour the facility.  They also developed Slippys, smaller versions of the Freaker for cups and mugs. All their products are available at their website and <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3faaj25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Amazon<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The company sells in thousands of gift shops too. I&#8217;ve seen them in my travels and 2 or 3 gift shops in my city carry them. They also did licensing deals with the NFL and DC Comics. Zach and the gang built a solid profitable company over the years and annual revenue as of March, 2024, is $6 million.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts about Freaker USA on the Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/freaker-feet-whoop\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Freaker Feet<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/whoop-its-the-freaker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Whoop!

On the site, it says &#8220;The estimated shipping date of this product is 3\/15\/2020.&#8221; Andy has not delivered on the IndieGoGo orders either as of August, 2020.<\/p>\n<p>In June, 2021, the IndieGoGo campaign was updated. Andy is awaiting delivery of a piston ring. He made this announcement in a campaign update:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Lately I’ve received a number of questions as to whether the project has been abandoned. I can’t blame people for asking, but I’m glad to reassure you that the pump’s progress is alive and well, and needs very little to be delivered. Scrapping the pump was never a thought for me, and in fact would cost me more than completing it. Covid notwithstanding, most of the other delays reflect a cautious approach specifically to avoid the danger of a project-killing mistake. I’ve certainly made some mistakes, and being over-cautious is likely one of them, but thankfully none of them has put the project itself at risk, and the enthusiastic support from backers has ensured that it will go through.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In November, 2021, he finally received confirmation that the product works. In yet another IndieGoGo update, he says:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The factory and I have been wrestling with the piston-and tube combination for a few months now, and the latest piston-and-tube sample has come in. The result: Victory at last! It works!<\/p>\n<p>It’s always easy to test the pieces and declare “this doesn’t work,” but it’s much harder to know why it didn’t work, or what needs fixing. Even harder is understanding how the factory can accomplish the new fix. This problem was maddening to me, especially because it seemed like it should&#8217;ve been so simple. In this case, the piston ring had at least 3 changes in shape (mostly how and where it attaches) and two changes in material type; the piston tube had two corresponding minor shape changes; and the main tube, inside of which the piston moves up and down, had two as well. And now, finally, I can forget about all of them. Except this final one.<\/p>\n<p>As I’ve said before, this is the final piece I was waiting for. So now the big question… when does production start? Here goes: first, they need to send me one more sample. Why? Because the factory insists on a final sample of everything working together. The recent package included only the piston tube and sealing rings, not a full pump set, so testing requires a mix-and-match with prior samples. After a few revisions that creates the potential for error. For another, at this stage each component comes with a dated sign-off tag to approve the look, feel, function and overall quality of the part, and it just makes sense. If they insist on this step for their own quality control, I won’t buck that process. That said, there aren’t any design changes or problems to fix, so the turnaround time should be quicker than previous rounds.<\/p>\n<p>After that’s cleared, it will be two weeks for the factory to plan the staffing, the floor space, and to &#8220;tee-up&#8221; the inventory of raw plastic, and another 2-3 weeks to run the assembly line, including the packaging. From there it goes to shipping. Shipping from China is usually 3 weeks of freight time + US mail time; however, due to the current backlog in container shipping, I will probably drop-ship directly from China to save time. I will confirm those details once production starts.<\/p>\n<p>And that’s the update! No pictures this time, as the parts are still covered in peanut butter. But the next one should have a full set of unboxing pics!<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to write me directly or leave a comment on the board using the links below. And as always, thank you so much for your enduring patience and kind support! Enjoy your Thanksgiving week!&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>By January, 2022, he finally got the missing piece for testing. He wrote this update on his IndieGogo page:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Backers,<\/p>\n<p>So, I’m ready to order production to start. Here’s what happened, and here’s what is coming.<\/p>\n<p>What happened:<\/p>\n<p>The package I was waiting for arrived, but it wasn’t what I expected. After I bugged and bugged them to deliver, on January 16<sup>th<\/sup> I got their email with a tracking number and a message: “We just sent the package, and you’ll get it in 5-10 days. It has less than what you’re expecting. Also, we’re closing from now until February 10<sup>th<\/sup> for the Chinese New Year.” I don’t like to complain about the factory, because good or bad the buck stops with me, not them. But I can’t hide my annoyance at getting a “here’s the minimum before we disappear on vacation” type of email. So I settled down to wait for the package. And when I got it, the frustration was fulfilled: instead of a few complete pumps, it had 4 production-quality piston rings.<\/p>\n<p>This is an example of getting not what I wanted, but only what was needed. As the final piece, it was necessary to receive and test the production units, instead of the one-offs from the last sample, before going forward. All other components have already been vetted. So I’m good to go. But I’m confused and annoyed by the factory’s behavior, and need a better understanding of their timeline. So that’s what’s coming up in the next few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>The main thing is to pin down the dates, and then the exact dimensions of size and weight for packaging. When I have firm dates, I’ll send them out.<\/p>\n<p>As always, thanks for supporting one of the nuttiest crowdfunding campaigns ever.

Best wishes,<\/p>\n<p>Andy<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>By July, 2022, he has still not delivered, but he&#8217;s getting closer. In an update to backers, he states &#8220;the pieces are in place for production.&#8221; In August, 2022, the production samples arrived and there were two problems that needed to be fixed before beginning actual productions. One problem was the factory gave him the wrong piston and the other was defective threads on the collar.<\/p>\n<p>In a June, 2023 update to his very patient backers, Andy says the factory is testing the piston for durability. In machine testing, the pistons cracked after 3000 pumps. A redesign got that up to 20,000 pumps and Andy&#8217;s factory has told him that once the testing is complete, the rest of the manufacturing process should go smoother. In the same update, he said he will have a production date &#8220;soon.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a May, 2024 update, Andy told his backers the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Backers,<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot to report today. As noted in the last update, factory tooling is on hold until more funds are raised. Accordingly, I&#8217;ve been making the rounds at local VC and investor clubs. It&#8217;s a slow turnaround affair. The good news is that I&#8217;ve gotten a number of opportunities to present it to potential investors, and a few have scheduled further discussions, which is a positive reaction even while it&#8217;s no guarantee. And until a commitment is made I have nothing to report. As they say, &#8220;a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,&#8221; and right now I have 3-4 &#8220;in the bush&#8221; without having one to bring home yet. I am confident one of them will come through, and I will be happy to report it to you all when that happens.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you to all who have written me with messages of kindness and encouragement.

Before their Kickstarter was even completed, cheap Chinese knock offs were flooding the US market. Alibaba had dozens of listings for the knockoffs. With a little urging from CNBC&#8217;s Nightly Business Report reporter Andrea Day, Alibaba removed the knock off manufacturers from their website. In September, 2020, the International Trade Commission issued a General Exclusion Order for Final Straw which bars importing products that infringe on their patent. You can learn more about that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/04\/30\/how-one-entrepreneurs-american-dream-turned-into-a-copycat-nightmare.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">HERE<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prweb.com\/releases\/final_issued_general_exclusion_order_for_its_patented_finalstraw\/prweb17444912.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">HERE<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While all that was going on, Emma Cohen sued Miles Pepper when she discovered that he, along with someone who worked in Final Straw&#8217;s outside marketing agency, were secretly attempting to launch a rival collapsible straw business. He also cancelled company credit cards and locked Cohen out of the company&#8217;s web properties. The suit must have been settled as Peppers&#8217; LinkedIn profile says he exited the company in February, 2019. There are no mentions of it after the initial suit either. Peppers started <a href=\"https:\/\/sanikind.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Sanikind<\/a>, a reusable hand sanitizer dispenser, with a successful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/sanikind\/sanikind-hand-sanitizer-for-the-modern-age\/description\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Kickstarter<\/a> campaign in August, 2020.<\/p>\n<h3>Trouble Brewing<\/h3>\n<p>Sales for the Final Straw tanked in 2020 too.

Together, the two campaigns raised over $500,000, but almost nothing was delivered. The wipes that were delivered had mold issues and were virtually useless after a few uses. No refunds were issued and the company went out of business. Deliveries for the first Kickstarter campaign back in 2018 weren&#8217;t made either.<\/p>\n<p>While Cohen still lists the business as &#8220;open&#8221; on her LinkedIn profile, social media hasn&#8217;t been updated since 2021 and the website will not let you order anything. There are also numerous Better Business Bureau complaints against the company. In January, 2022, the registered LLC for the company in California was listed as &#8220;forfeited.&#8221; It turns out, she re-branded to Final Co. and the company is still in business as of July, 2024.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/final-straw\/"},"LugLess Luggage Shipping":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/lugless\/\">Lugless Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>In spite of sinking in the Shark Tank, Altomare continued to grow his business after the show.

Instead, in May of 2019, Mark&#8217;s venture capital firm, Radical investments, joined with venture firms VegInvest, Felicis Ventures, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Mars Petcare, Bits x Bites, VECTR, and P.O.V. to fund Wild Earth with $11 million in venture funding. That brings the company&#8217;s total venture debt to $16 million!<\/p>\n<p>In September, 2021, he company moved from California to Durham, NC due to the covid-19 pandemic restrictions in California and a lower cost of doing business.

Despite that, they did one million dollars in sales in the six days following their air date. Their old site can&#8217;t stand up to the traffic. They tried re-vamping the old site, but it didn&#8217;t work out to their satisfaction. They figured fixing the old site and redesigning a new site costs the same money &#8211; about $250K.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is, sales went up to $14 million and profits went up 100%. Average order size is up 10 dollars per customer. When they approach Mark about the new site, he thinks it could be catastrophic. One of the reasons is changes to the site cause stability problems. He thinks sales could suffer if they make too many changes. Diana wants bigger photos, but Mark thinks &#8220;perfection is the enemy of profitability.&#8221; He wants to accelerate the current site.<\/p>\n<p>Josh and Diana still want a new site. Mark thinks he knows what they&#8217;re going through and they should trust him. He has the team to keep the old site running and they&#8217;ve kept it going (with a big increase in sales) since the deal was made, so he&#8217;s averse to changing things and potentially crashing the whole site. Josh and Diana still want to go ahead with the site and tell Mark they&#8217;ve signed a deal. Mark isn&#8217;t happy.<\/p>\n<p>Josh understands the risk, but Mark says changing the site could still be too big of a risk. He&#8217;ll offer his advice and support for the new site, but he&#8217;s still not pleased. After all was said and done, Diana still sees Mark as a mentor, but she&#8217;ll own the decision; her biggest concern is a better customer experience with the website. Mark doesn&#8217;t agree with their choice but he&#8217;s vowed to help them succeed.<\/p>\n<p>In an update segment in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/shark-tank-season-7-episodes\/episode-702\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 702<\/a>, Josh and Diana re-live the website dilemma and reveal they didn&#8217;t go with a new site. They ultimately took Mark&#8217;s advice and sales have never been better. The money they didn&#8217;t spend on the new site saved them cash they spent on developing a Red Dress app and their own clothing line. As a result, Red Dress did over $14 million in sales in 2014! They also opened a brick and mortar store called Fringe in Athens, Georgia.<\/p>\n<p>On January 17, 2019, Diana announced on her Instagram that she bought back her equity from the Sharks for an undisclosed amount.<\/p>\n<p>As of December, 2022, the business changed its name to &#8220;Red Dress.&#8221; By July, 2024, annual revenue is $29 million.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts About Red Dress Boutique on Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/the-red-dress-boutique\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">The Red Dress Boutique<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Red Dress Boutique Information<\/h2>\n<p><a style=\"color: #01b5b7;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.reddressboutique.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a style=\"color: #01b5b7;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheRedDressBoutique\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a style=\"color: #01b5b7;\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ShopRedDress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Video<br \/>\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qprg3neqg3s\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/red-dress-boutique\/"},"BeatBox Beverages":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/beatbox-beverages\/\">BeatBox Beverages Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>BeatBox Beverages went forward with Mark Cuban and is featured in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/beyond-the-tank\/beyond-the-tank-season-two-episodes\/beyond-tank-episode-110\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Beyond the Tank episode 110<\/a>. Read a full recap and update <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/beyond-the-tank\/beyond-the-tank-season-two-episodes\/beyond-tank-episode-110\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">HERE<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward to November, 2021 and Beat Box is the fastest growing brand in its category.

In the update, Mitch, Barbara and a herd of Santas go to Bloomingdale&#8217;s in New York. The company is going to provide Santas to the flagship New York store. Barbara and Mitch meet with a store executive to &#8220;finalize the deal,&#8221; then they oversee Santa auditions. Mitch announces he did $1.4 million in sales in 2018. Mitch hired marketing people with Barbara&#8217;s investment and he went out and closed deals with Great Wolf Lodge and others. He paid Barbara back, too.<\/p>\n<p>2020 saw demand for Santa exceed supply as pandemic related lockdowns killed retail Santa displays in most places. Hire Santa offered a Zoom visit with Santa for $49, far less than the typical hourly rates Santa commands. They offer pre-recorded video messages too. Their website suggests they plan on keeping that service, so they have another revenue stream!<\/p>\n<p>In 2022, as the country started looking at the Covid-19 pandemic in the rear view mirror, virtual Santa services fell 85% from 2020 to 2021 and another 50% from 2021 to 2022. There was also a &#8220;Santa shortage&#8221; in 2022 at Hire Santa as more companies and brands sought out Santa to appear at their functions. Demand exceeded supply and Hire Santa had to up its recruiting. Part of the reason for the Santa scarcity is some people left their Santa roles due to concerns over Covid. Despite the difficulties, Hire Santa rebounded to pre-pandemic revenue levels.<\/p>\n<h3>Another Update Segment<\/h3>\n<p>The company gets a second update segment in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/season-15-shark-tank-episodes\/episode-1510\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 1510<\/a>, season 15&#8217;s &#8220;Holiday Special.&#8221; In the update segment, Barbara says she loves her holiday entrepreneurs. Holiball and Hire Santa are coming together to have a holiday extravaganza at The historic Grand Galves Hotel. The ballroom is decorated with Holiballs and there&#8217;s a Santa talking to a bunch of kids. All guests are bringing presents to donate to the less fortunate. Mitch is addressing a roomful of Santas saying they&#8217;ll be bringing joy to children. Barbara says Mitch is the hardest working guy she&#8217;s ever dealt with. Mitch says when he first came on Shark Tank, he had less than $700,000 in sales over 10 years. In the 5 years since doing the deal with Barbara, he has over $7 million in sales.

Beanstack is an online curriculum for helping with reading challenges. The restructuring of the company appears to have brought success, and the business continues to grow.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, they rolled out the Beanstack curriculum to their first library.

Amazon’s Alexa Fund also invested in the business in 2019. In 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, they introduced free reading challenges to prevent learning loss through its Beanbright platform. This prompted more libraries to sign on to the platform. As of January, 2023, the company announced it had achieved 5 billion minutes read on its platform.

They sold their business to I think a Chinese Supplier. I believe they&#8217;ve retained the domain TheElephantPants.com, but have redirected it to TheElephantPantz.com which the new owner owns. New owner is shady and rips people off.<b>Their Customers feedback since then:<br \/>\n<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheElephantPants\/photos\/a.293700537503718\/1055864697953961\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheElephantPants\/photos\/a.293700537503718\/1055864697953961\/<\/a><b>The New Owners<br \/>\n<\/b>The new owners made a shitty site and have stolen our images.

They did this to us last, but were going after smaller online sellers for years before this. Some of our competitors reached out to us about this ahead of time, and we offered to pay their legal bills and help out anyway we could. The reason for this is, we live in Thailand where these pants come from. In Thai they&#8217;re referred to as &#8220;Elephant Pants&#8221;. These douchebags came to TH, took the name, went back to US and registered a similar trademark &#8220;The Elephant Pants&#8221; and attempted to threaten other domestic sellers of these pants with scare tactics. When they attempted to sue us, we refused to comply and told them we&#8217;d take it to court and would just waste money fighting the case. We would also attempt to get their trademark invalidated. It&#8217;s important for us that other domestic sellers can continue to sell using the words &#8220;Elephant Pants&#8221;. The funny thing is, out of respect to their business, we never actually used the terms &#8220;Elephant Pants&#8221; on our website before they sued us. We always used &#8220;Elephant Harem Pants&#8221;. They still attempted to sue us and sent a copyright claim to Shopify and got our Website taken down temporarily. <b>Their Supplier<\/b><\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<blockquote><p>Elephant Pants used a local manufacturer in Chiang Mai, Thailand to make their pants.  I think Elephant Pants stopped paying them, and put them in massive debt before they Elephant Pants closed down.

They have expanded distribution and can be found in just about any place that sells wine. According to a Boston area distributor, the wine sold &#8220;very well&#8221; during the summer of 2012. The single serve wine business is apparently everything James Martin thought it was and NOT getting a deal with the Sharks may be the best thing to happen to Mr. Martin.<\/p>\n<p>Martin got the last laugh on the Sharks. In 2015, the business is approaching $20 million in annual sales. I personally can&#8217;t recall the last time I didn&#8217;t see the product in a liquor store &#8211; it&#8217;s everywhere. The company is valued at $70 million, making it one of the more successful businesses to appear on Shark Tank.<\/p>\n<p>In January, 2021, James Martin finally cashed in when the business was acquired by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsfilecorp.com\/redirect\/eW31COoB8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Splash Beverage Group, Inc<\/a>. for an undisclosed amount.

The pair enjoyed expanded support following the airing, expanding their sales and growing the company. Several large camo manufacturers approached them in hopes of landing a licensing deal.<\/p>\n<p>2015 might have brought muddied waters, however.

Muddy Water Camo may face rough sailing, if the owners can&#8217;t iron out their differences and learn to blend in.<\/p>\n<p>It appears the lawsuit may have been settled as there is nothing out there about it other than the initial filing.

The social media is active and thriving, and the blog is regularly updated, all good signs of a healthy and growing company. The cricket-based protein bars have been a big hit with consumers interested in &#8220;green&#8221; eating choices, and several large retailers have expressed interest in the line as well. While crunching on crickets might not be everyone&#8217;s idea of a tasty snack, Chapul is hopping onto the scene as the next solution to the world&#8217;s need for cheap, renewable protein.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/shark-tank-season-7-episodes\/episode-716\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 716<\/a> in season 7, Chapul was the featured &#8220;update segment.&#8221; Pat tells the viewing audience &#8220;Chapul cricket bars are hopping off the shelf!&#8221; The product is in all 217 Sprouts stores; they are the first major retailer to carry insect bars. To date, they have $750K in sales and they&#8217;re on track for $1.5 million this year. Pat became a dad since he aired and he wants to continue to make the world a better place. Thanks to Mark and Shark Tank, it&#8217;s happening!<\/p>\n<p>In 2016, Daniel Lubetsky of Kind Bars fame invested an undisclosed amount in the business. This was long before he became a guest Shark. In 2019, Chapul got out of the protein bar business when his co-packer went out of business. The company now only sells the <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3AQMwN5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">cricket flour<\/a>. Pat is working with a group that helps new insect farming ventures in Indonesia get started.<\/p>\n<h3>Black Soldier Fly Farming<\/h3>\n<p>In February, 2022, the company raised an additional $2.5 million from Mark Cuban, Daniel Lubetzky and Nexus PMG. The funds will be used to  create and build the Chapul Farms’ Insect Innovation &amp; Research Center in McMinnville, Oregon. The facility will use black solider fly larvae to consume food waste and upcycle food to prevent it from ending up in landfills. The insects produce larvae, used in human food and animal food products as protein, and insect manure (frass), used as an alternative to synthetic fertilizers.<\/p>\n<p>Chapul gets an update segment in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/season-13-shark-tank-episodes\/episode-1320\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 1320<\/a>. In the segment, Pat says he was in over 500 stores with the bars, but he wasn&#8217;t getting people to buy again. Then he talks about the co-packer going out of business. Next, he talks about the new farm and how he came to meet Daniel Lubetzky. The company has $2 million in lifetime sales. The new farm will be ready in 2023 and will provide 70 jobs. Once operational, it should generate $20 million in sales per year.<\/p>\n<p>By November, 2022, the bigger picture became clear. The company is in the business of building insect farms. Chapul is, at this time, building seven of these farms which are in &#8220;the latter stages of development.&#8221; By March, 2023, the company farm was open in McMinnville, OR. Now, in addition to the  cricket flour, the company sells Black Soldier Fly meal, oil, live larvae and frass (poop) for use in pet food, chicken farming, aquaculture and as soil amendments. They also build insect farming facilities for others.<\/p>\n<p>In April, 2023, the company raised another $10 million in series A funding. They also signed an agreement with The Spiritwood Energy Park Association in Jamestown, ND to develop an insect farm there. It should be completed some time in 2024. The big picture is they plan to have 20 of these facilities nationwide by 2032. As of April, 2024, the company is generating revenue, but reliable numbers are unavailable.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts About Chapul on Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/cricket-energy-bars-chapul\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Cricket Energy Bars<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Chapul Information<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3AQMwN5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">BUY NOW on Amazon<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/chapul.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ChapulRevolution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/eatinsects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/chapul\/"},"SENDaBALL":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/send-a-ball\/\">Send a Ball Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Despite their defeat in the Shark Tank, the Send a Ball sisters are still going strong.

Only 1 out of 3 on air deals actually close, but three months is still a short time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As of October, 2020, the deal with Kevin has closed and they are getting an update segment in season twelve, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/season-12-shark-tank-episodes\/episode-1205\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 1205<\/a>.

As of November, 2021, annual revenue is $6 million. In February, 2022, the company raised $20 million to bring their total venture investments to $35 million. Part of the funds will drive their entry into retail which should begin in Q1, 2023. As of August, 2022, they are projecting 2022 revenue in the neighborhood of $10 million. In 2023, they boast over 100,000 online customers. They are in Target, Costco, The Container Store and other small retailers nationwide. In October, 2023, the company was the 15th largest Shark Tank company in sales with lifetime sales of $160 million.<\/p>\n<h3>More Updates<\/h3>\n<p>The company gets an update segment in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/season-15-shark-tank-episodes\/episode-1509\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 1509<\/a>. In the update, they reiterate their mission of creating products that reduce plastic packaging. They tout Shopify, their online store platform which makes it easy to upload new products without being computer engineers. When their episode aired, they got more traffic than they could have imagined and their site never went down.<\/p>\n<p>Before Shark Tank, they were in business just 2 months with sales of $200,000. Since appearing, they have $170 million in sales (they made $10 million more since last October). They&#8217;re now in Costco, Target, Erewhon and they recently launched nationwide into Whole Foods. One of the best ways they attract new customers in retail is through their plastic swaps. They invite people to bring in their cleaning products to swap them for one of theirs that can be used forever.  Kevin made a video of him wearing all his single use plastic which they show onscreen. Kevin says there&#8217;s a whole generation of people who don&#8217;t want to use single use plastics and Blueland solved the problem. Blueland is now a brand.<\/p>\n<p>Shopify invited the Blueland folks to their offices to show them their latest features. Sarah says Shopify has been an asset to small businesses everywhere. She says without Shopify, they couldn&#8217;t have created a business at the speed they did. The platform allows their brand and mission to shine through. To date, they&#8217;ve eliminated over 1 billion single use plastic containers from the ocean and landfills and they&#8217;re just getting started. As of July, 2024, the company is valued at over $220 million.<\/p>\n<p>The Shark Tank Blog will follow-up on Blueland as <span id=\"IL_AD1\" class=\"IL_AD\">more details<\/span> become available.<\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/blueland\/"},"Third Wave Water Makes Coffee Tastes Better":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/third-wave-water\/\">Third Wave Water Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>The deal with Barbara did not close, but they still have access to some of the people she uses with her entrepreneurs.

Flexscreen will supply this window manufacturer with screens from its newest factory in Nashua, New Hampshire &#8211; the company&#8217;s seventh factory.

The company initially aired during the early stages of Covid-19 related lockdowns. Katey had a lot of inventory on hand in anticipation of the Shark Tank effect and she couldn&#8217;t sell it so they went direct to consumer with some success. Then, a Wal Mart buyer came calling. Katey re-branded to Frobet, a combo of frozen yogurt and sorbet, and she&#8217;s in 4300 Wal Mart stores! She&#8217;s also in Stop &amp; Shop and every Kroger store too. Before Shark Tank, she had $300,000 or so in sales. Now, she has over $1 million for the year and $15 million in committed purchase orders. This deal worked out well. In 2022, Lori predicts they&#8217;ll do over $20 million in sales.<\/p>\n<p>In June, 2022, the company got a $2.5 million line of credit from WSFS Bank to fuel its explosive growth. At the time the company secured the credit line, they were in over 8000 stores. In March, 2023, the company launched in Kroger stores. As a promotion to publicize the shelf placement, Frobet partnered with multi-platinum country music star Jimmie Allen to create Miss Angie&#8217;s Peach Cobbler Frobert. The recipe is based on one of Allen&#8217;s mother&#8217;s recipes and is exclusive to Kroger. 2022 sales were over $20 million and should continue to grow.<\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/frozen-farmer\/"},"Better Bedder Bed Sheet Holder Belt":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/better-bedder\/\">Better Bedder Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>The deal with Lori did close and the Better Bedder website got a complete overhaul right after the show aired.

A little under 50 of those emails were from interested investors. Since the Shark Tank aired in February of this year, I found the missing link from years before. I’ve gotten a CTO on board who’s helped facilitate and finance the new face and technology behind the new Cheekd. The newly launched dating app allows users to solve missed connections with a new technology that was not available when the patented Cheekd ideawas launched in 2010. It was only a matter of time and I’m thankful I didn’t take the Sharks advice to quit and move on. While the physical cards worked anywhere in the world and were a perfect way to break the ice, we found a few barriers; the main one being that our users were still quite intimidated to walk up and slip a card to a total stranger.  Looking into alternatives of ways we could change the platform, we discovered a way to make these IRL encounters much easier and less intimidating via a mobile solution. Previously, with the Cheek&#8217;d Version1, users would use a set of clever cards to introduce themselves to individuals they encounter in the offline world who sparked their interest. If the interest was mutual, the card recipients used the card’s unique code to reconnect easily with the person via a private online profile viewable at Cheekd.com.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The newly launched Cheekd reimagines online dating with a new app that makes missed connections obsolete. Cheekd uses a cross-platform low energy Bluetooth technology, which fosters hyper local engagement. The app connects people in real-time, versus virtual time. Connections begin in person; Cheekd helps you take the next step and continue the conversation online.<\/p>\n<p>Cheekd ensures you ‘Never Miss a Connection’; thanks to this new Bluetooth technology, the app works on the train; on a plane… anywhere—You’ll get an immediate notification if someone who meets your criteria is within 30 feet of you.  If you’re near a potential spark, Cheekd makes sure you know about it.

Alfred Pirri claimed Cheek stole the idea he made up in 2007. He claims he told his therapist about it who then told Cheek. That case was dismissed in April, 2018. The following year, in October, 2019, the same man sued Cheek for defamation. He claimed he was calling him &#8220;crazy&#8221; on social media. That case was dismissed in March, 2021 and Pirri was ordered to pay Cheek&#8217;s attorneys fees. As of November, 2023, the company is still operating with estimated revenues of $1 million per year.<\/p>\n<h2>Posts About Cheek&#8217;d on Shark Tank Blog<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/dating-cards-cheekd\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Dating Cards<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Cheek&#8217;d Information<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cheekd.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cheekd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Cheekd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Cheek&#8217;d Video<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/KQbAtHhWj18\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/cheekd\/"},"2400 Expert SAT, ACT and College Prep":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/2400-expert\/\">2400 Expert Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Mark Cuban invested in Shaan&#8217;s business because he believes in education, and that decision has made him an even richer man.

The two companies entered into a distribution agreement in 2014 whereby Anthem would distribute the Under the Weather products online. Sales of Under the Weather products increased dramatically. Things went south in 2015 when Under the Weather increased its wholesale prices to Anthem to a point where Anthem couldn&#8217;t make a profit. It was at this time Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods began offering Under the Weather products online and in stores. Anthem also alleged Under the Weather infringed on its trademark SportPod™. Anthem further alleged that UTW was disparaging its products on social media. The court dismissed all the various counts Anthem alleged in 2018 except the breach of contract and trademark infringement claims. Anthem then demanded a jury trial and the case has either been settled or has been in limbo since. Both companies continue to sell their versions of their &#8220;Sportspods&#8221; but UTW has stopped using the term and now calls it the &#8220;My Pod.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When 2020 rolled around, sales dropped 70% because nobody was going to sporting events, so Rick pivoted.

Today they&#8217;re in nearly 400 retail stores including Sam&#8217;s Club, Costco and Target.<\/p>\n<p>They started in a 1400 square foot facility and now they have a 10,000 square foot facility. When they went into the Tank, they&#8217;d been in business 11 months and had $250,000 in revenue. Since then, they&#8217;ve done $1.1 million in sales. Mark says they had a vision and they went for it. Chaz and Whitney eat, sleep and breathe their business. They took everything they had &#8211; $100,000 &#8211; and went all in. A video clip shows them introducing their creamy chocolate martini flavor. Mark goes on to say that as black wine makers, they&#8217;re a rarity. As a rarity, their community looks up to them and when you compound that with being successful and growing so quickly, they&#8217;ll be encouraging entrepreneurs accross the country.<\/p>\n<p>Chaz says there aren&#8217;t a lot of people in the wine business who look like them. They have 2 boys now who look up to them. There are also a lot of people in the community who look up to them and see they&#8217;re breaking curses from the past that would have held them back, but they persevered. If they walk away with one message, it&#8217;s that young people can do it too and create generational wealth for their families. They are living proof that you can break barriers one glass at a time.<\/p>\n<p>The Shark Tank Blog will follow-up on Wondry &amp; Chaz and Whitney Gates as <span id=\"IL_AD1\" class=\"IL_AD\">more details<\/span> become available.<\/p>\n","blogLink":"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/wondry\/"},"Like Air Puffcorn":{"blogBody":"<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/business\/like-air\/\">Like Air Shark Tank Update<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>As of the first re-run of this episode in June, 2024 (about 6 months after the original air date), there is no evidence the deal with Mark and Lori closed.

Later in 2018, they rebranded the company name to Kitu Life as a mash up of ‘key to life’ and keto. That same year, as a direct result of their Shark Tank appearance, Patrick Schwarzenegger(Arnold&#8217;s son) invested in the business. In 2019, they introduced creamers and raised $25 million from venture capitalists, including Aaron Rogers&#8217; Rx3 Ventures, to fuel growth. Also in 2019, the three brothers made the Forbes 30 under 30  list.<\/p>\n<p>In 2020, they had $55 million in sales. The same year, former NBA star and early investor in Vitamin Water, Baron Davis invested in the business; so did A-Rod and J-Lo. By 2021, they hired Rosanna Godden, former finance vice president at Whole Foods Market, as its chief financial officer. Godden left the company in early 2022 and Tyler Ricks became CEO. Ricks previously worked for Peet&#8217;s Coffee, Mighty Leaf Tea, and Lipton Tea. Sales in 2021 are projected at $97 million and the company is valued at $400 million.<\/p>\n<p>In late 2020, they inked a distribution partnership with Anheuser-Busch. This allowed them to get their product in to Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Target and thousands of convenience stores. In August, 2021, the company raised another $106 million at a $500 million valuation. The company&#8217;s products are currently available in only 40% of U.S. retail outlets, but that still makes them the third-largest manufacturer of bottled coffee in the USA behind Starbucks and Dunkin. The Anheuser-Busch deal will likely catapult them to the top soon. As of April, 2022, they expect sales to top $100 million for the year.<\/p>\n<p>In May, 2022, the company announced that rapper Vanilla Ice would be a spokesperson for its new Vanilla Iced Latte flavor. As of August, 2022, it was revealed 2021 revenue topped $97 million and the company is mulling an IPO to expand globally.

Players are bombarding golf courses, asking if they allow Fling Golf. It&#8217;s even being played at elite courses like Pebble Beach, Torrey Pines, Streamsong Resort and Chambers Bay.

By July, 2022, the sport is available at over 2,000 courses in the USA and over 3,000 courses worldwide in 36 countries, including a few dozen US military bases. 2021 sales were $1.3 million. 2022 sales should be at least twice that based on the progression of the sport. ESPN will aired the San Diego FlingGolf Open in August of 2023.
