When their original episode aired, they sold more mini bagel balls in one night than they had in two months!

Lori helped them close a deal to test the product in 32 New York City Starbucks which led to Bagel Stuffins getting into 400 Starbucks. Eventually, they hope to be in all 7000 plus stores. Bantam Bagels are also available on all Delta Airlines flights out of New York City.<\/p>\n<p>Nick and Elyse exclaim &#8220;we&#8217;re going to change the way America bagels!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In season eight, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharktankblog.com\/shark-tank\/shark-tank-episodes\/shark-tank-season-8-episodes\/episode-810\/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">episode 810<\/a>, Bantam Bagels gets a second update segment. In the update, Bantam announces they sold their business to T. Marzetti Co., a subsidiary of the Lancaster Colony food company, for $34 million. Nick and Elyse will continue to operate the company and it will keep the original Manhattan store. Bantam does $20 million in annual sales. As of November, 2021, they have their product in over 9000 Starbucks stores and they continue to sell <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3uBacBf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">online<\/a>. In December, 2021, the products launched in Aldi supermarkets.<\/p>\n<p>In June, 2021, Lancaster announced it was exiting the Bantam Bagels business and seeking to sell the company&#8217;s production equipment. A company spokesman said he didn&#8217;t foresee a path to profitability. Part of the reason Bantam underperformed is it lost its distribution in Starbucks due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Whether the brand continues or not remains to be seen. In September, 2022, the website is down, social media accounts have been deleted and the Amazon store is gone. It looks like the brand didn&#8217;t survive.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n"}

The only sign of Classroom Jams online is Furigay&#8217;s personal LinkedIn account and a website with a non-functional store.  There is no website or Facebook presence. Classroom Jams seems to have closed shop, unfortunately for the students who must study Shakespeare unaccompanied by music.<\/p>\n<p>Furigay moved on to become the educational director for Street Level Youth Media, &#8220;a program for inner-city youth in Chicago that educates about media and technology to build self esteem and critical thinking skills,&#8221; In 2011. In 2016, he became an English teacher at the Dyett High School for the Arts in Chicago. He resurrected his website and now sells the album The Shakespeare Sessions for $9.99. He also sells teaching guides for Hamlet, MacBeth, Romeo and Juliet and poetry. As of July, 2021, he&#8217;s planning on getting back to school after a year and a half of remote learning due to the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>\n<h2>Classroom Jams Information<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mfurigay.wix.com\/shakespeare-sessions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Marc Furigay on LinkedIn\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/marcfurigay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.street-level.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Street Level Youth Media<\/a><\/p>\n"}

The new layouts let customers customize what they want in their gardens. As of August, 2023, the company is in business and earning $5 million in annual revenue.

It&#8217;s possible that, given an opportunity, Lori and Mark would have joined together to offer an even better deal, but the &#8220;man crush&#8221; won out. Unfortunately, the deal never closed.
