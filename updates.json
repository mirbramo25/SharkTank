This would help get it to market much faster and at a much larger scale. Susie said that she could not pursue that route “morally” because of the toxins used in Chinese factories overseas.</p><p>\nWhen Susie said she wanted to prove that America could produce great quality products domestically, Kevin went on the offensive again. He said that America can make great products, but they can’t afford Bibbitec because the price was outrageous.</p><p>\nSteve tried to build excitement talking about the response Bibbitec received at tradeshows, but the sharks remained unconvinced. Daymond John tried tossing a lifeline to this failing pitch, asking if the Taylors truly believed they could get the cost down. The Taylors said that, with a large enough order, they should get the cost lower.</p><p>\nBy now, Susie was losing her cool and began acting defensively to the sharks' criticism. Robert addressed the talk of lowering costs and said it was a good plan, but he didn’t understand the Taylors’ plan to sell thousands of Bibbitec bibs to the mass market.</p><p>\nMark Cuban said he liked the bib and was not deterred by the price point but he personally found the Taylors very much unequipped to run the business. He advised they find a college kid to launch an Internet marketing campaign on the cheap and get the word out. Mark said there were solutions out there to their problems, but the solution was not him, so he was out.</p><p>\nBarbara Corcoran spoke next, stating that Mark’s advice was very good. She also told the Taylors that there was likely an equally passionate salesforce available– other moms. With that, she was out. Kevin was not at all interested in investing, so he too went out.</p><p>\nDaymond John went out next, as he felt he could offer no value to the Taylors. Robert went out last, telling the Taylors that their pitch included a number of confusing strategies, and that he personally felt they had no clear plan for success. With that, they were forced to leave without a deal. What happened next? Keep reading our Bibbitec update to find out!</p><p>\nAs with many pitches, exposure from the show led to a spike in sales, and they sold nearly $40,000 in one weekend! Despite this, after some time sales became stagnant to the point where the product was no longer available. In 2019, the business closed down, so this will be our final Bibbitec update.</p>\n",

Kevin O’Leary came in with one of  \"Mr. Wonderful\" royalty deals. He offered $90,000, but he wanted a 5% royalty of everything in return.</p><p>\nLori offered an incredible $900,000 in exchange for 30% equity. Daymond John decided to offer $1 million in exchange for 25% equity. Lori and Daymond bickered about who would do things better for Michael and PlateTopper, but Robert Herjavec interrupted to find out if Michael was seriously considering Kevin’s offer. Michael candidly said he was not, and that he would like to respectfully decline Mr. Wonderful’s offer.</p><p>\nAt this juncture, things started getting messy. Michael began talking about the valuation, and how he believed his company to be worth considerably more than the $1.8 million valuation that his original ask was structured around. For this reason, Daymond went out, stating that Michael was starting to rub him the wrong way.</p><p>\nAt this point, Lori reconsidered her offer and decided to roll it back from $900,000 to $90,000 in exchange for 5%. Lori was now offering exactly what Michael asked for, yet he didn’t accept. Robert went out next, unwilling to take any risks investing.</p><p>\nThe sharks continued pushing Michael to come clean about his true valuation since he was unwilling to accept the $90,000 for 5% deal he originally asked for, and he finally agreed to reveal the real offer he had in mind, which was $750,000 for 5%. This assumed PlateTopper was worth $15 million that day, an assumption the sharks were not eager to make.</p><p>\nMark Cuban, undeterred by the seemingly wishy-washy behavior shown by Michael, asked him how much a line of credit would be worth to him. Michael excused himself from the tank to call his younger brother, and when he returned, he asked for $1.5 million in exchange for 10% equity. With that, Mark went out.</p><p>\nWhen Michael started to counter Mark, rather than talk to Lori about her offer, she amended her offer again, to $90,000 for 10% equity. Michael countered with 5% for the $90,000, and asked if any sharks wanted to come back in, even asking if the sharks would have a bidding war for his company. The sharks adamantly rejected this, and Lori said she would do $90,000 for 8% equity if Michael accepted immediately.</p><p>\nFinally, Michael accepted the offer and the deal was closed. His pitch would go down in Shark Tank history as the longest and most drawn out segment. What happened next for the company? Keep reading our PlateTopper update to find out!</p><p>\nAs it would turn out, the deal with Lori never closed. Despite this,  PlateTopper continued selling on QVC and in WalMart stores. Michael would then develop a bowl topper, and sell various products in retail stores and online. However, the PlateTopper would disappear from shelves and sales would be discontinued online as well. As of October 2022, the company is out of business. This will be our final PlateTopper update.</p>\n",

She revealed that she would make no profit that year whatsoever, and had made no profit at all from The Green Garmento. The sharks were stunned. Jennie tried to brush past, saying she was “just four years in” and it was too early to expect profits, but the sharks disagreed. How could a company generate $1 million in sales and see no return on investment? For the sharks, this was a massive red flag.</p><p>\nRobert asked how much money Jennie was losing, and Jennie said she was losing $10,000 per month. He asked how much she lost last year, and Jennie claimed that she didn’t know. She violated the Shark Tank cardinal rule– know thy numbers!</p><p>\nJennie continued peeling back layers, and revealed that she had invested $380,000 into her product, and also had taken on a collection of “non-equity investors.” The sharks were stunned again, and Mark asked what the investors got for their money if not equity.</p><p>\nJennie said that these investors were receiving 9% of all revenue off the top until their money was paid back. Mark asked how much money she took from these investors, and Jennie answered that she had accepted $900,000 from them.</p><p>\nKevin asked how much of the $900,000 Jennie had already paid back, and she said “not very much.” With the truth finally coming to light, the sharks would fall like dominoes. Robert went first, telling Jennie she had a great product, but he couldn’t see past the elephant in the room. For that reason, he was out.</p><p>\nBarbara left next, also applauding the product design, but stating she could not justify “buying into a problem.” Kevin would not go quietly, sharing the cold, hard truth about green products and claiming that everyone wants to save the world unless it costs them something. He said this was the reason why solar “doesn’t work,” wind “doesn’t work,” and why The Green Garmento “won’t work.” He was out.</p><p>\nMark left the tank with a lesson. He said that many investors followed her path, accruing debt under the assumption that more money would make their business successful. They, and Jennie, would learn the hard way that “debt is not your friend.” With that, Mark was out. The last shark remaining was Daymond, and he didn't remain long. He too was out.</p><p>\nWith no offers from the sharks, Jennie was forced to leave the tank without a deal. How did things go for Jennie after the pitch? Keep reading The Green Garmento update to find out!</p><p>\nWe have fantastic news to share in The Green Garmento update! In a shocking twist, they worked out well for Jennie's company.

Scott replied that he needed the capital to build infrastructure, outfit a nursery with an automatic irrigation system, and create control over his own inventory by growing trees from seedlings to maturity.</p><p>\nKevin O”Leary shared that seasonal businesses were not for him, due to their relatively short time period. He also wasn't pleased with the price point, plus felt plastic trees would look just as nice. For these reasons, he was out.</p><p>\nDaymond John felt differently. He liked that Scott created a green alternative to killing trees seasonally, only to wind up tossing them out with the trash. However, he was concerned that, as the price of gas increased and the trees became larger and required more land and fertilizer, operating costs would increase and hurt the profitability of the operation. For this reason, he was out next.</p><p>\nRobert said he didn’t want to be a Grinch, but he was “not seeing the growth curve.” Because he didn’t believe it would scale attractively, he too was out. Barbara applauded Scott's mission, but urged him to consider his fairly meager profit of $33,000 as an indicator that something is wrong. For that reason, Barbara was out.</p><p>\nMark, on the other hand, voiced his reservations but provided Scott the opportunity to explain the merits of his business further. When Scott said that scaling would create an estimated 200 additional jobs, Mark offered $150,000 for 40% equity.</p><p>\nWithout negotiation, Scott accepted, and the deal was made. How did things go after the tank? Did Mark bring loads of Christmas presents to The Living Christmas Company in the form of big profits, or did they wind up with lumps of coal? Keep reading The Living Christmas Company update to find out!</p><p>\nWe have great news! As promised, Mark helped grow The Living Christmas Company, and Scott created jobs for military veterans, homeless people, and ex-convicts in need of work. In the infamously short holiday selling season, Scott and Mark were able to bring sales up to $300,000 that first season.
