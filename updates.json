The playful, paint-on application took a little of the sting out of childhood scrapes, and there was no painful adhesive that stuck to sore skin when it was time to come off.</p><p>\nThe sharks immediately wanted to know what made the product different from the well-known alternative; a spray-on liquid bandage application that dries clear.

According to Andrew, 70% of bandage users are kids 3-15 years old. The liquid bandage competition hadn’t yet been able to tap into that market.</p><p>\nMark Cuban was the first shark out.

Daymond John went out because he said education wasn’t an area he had much experience in, unlike fellow sharks Kevin O'Leary, Mark Cuban, and guest shark Chris Sacca.</p><p>\nChris showed his interest but advised that the lack of advertising might need to be reconsidered. He also made an offer of $400,000 for a 4.85% stake.</p><p>\nDave asked Chris if he would consider teaming up with another shark, but Chris didn’t rank the other sharks for their skills in education.</p><p>\nThis led to an extended quarrel between Chris and Mark that Daymond seemed to enjoy witnessing. Kevin took advantage of the squabbling to change his offer, matching Chris’ for $400,000 at 4.85%.</p><p>\nMark joined the offers with $400,000 at 4%, the stake Dave initially had on the table. Daymond asked if Dave would consider more money for a higher stake, and Dave replied in the affirmative.</p><p>\nDave countered with $600,000 for 6% equity, and Chris countered that with a joint deal with him and Mark with $600,000 for 6.67%.</p><p>\nDave asked Mark if he’d match that, and Mark said he would. Dave accepted the deal, and shook hands with the two sharks, leaving the tank with two new partners.</p><p>\nNow let's check in for a Brightwheel update to see what happened after the episode aired.</p><p>\nBrightwheel has been thriving since appearing on Shark Tank. Mark and Chris were instrumental in the growth of the company, securing more investments and connections.</p><p>\nOur Brightwheel update research found that the company now has an estimated valuation of $600 million.

Kevin O’Leary came in with one of  \"Mr. Wonderful\" royalty deals. He offered $90,000, but he wanted a 5% royalty of everything in return.</p><p>\nLori offered an incredible $900,000 in exchange for 30% equity. Daymond John decided to offer $1 million in exchange for 25% equity. Lori and Daymond bickered about who would do things better for Michael and PlateTopper, but Robert Herjavec interrupted to find out if Michael was seriously considering Kevin’s offer. Michael candidly said he was not, and that he would like to respectfully decline Mr. Wonderful’s offer.</p><p>\nAt this juncture, things started getting messy. Michael began talking about the valuation, and how he believed his company to be worth considerably more than the $1.8 million valuation that his original ask was structured around. For this reason, Daymond went out, stating that Michael was starting to rub him the wrong way.</p><p>\nAt this point, Lori reconsidered her offer and decided to roll it back from $900,000 to $90,000 in exchange for 5%. Lori was now offering exactly what Michael asked for, yet he didn’t accept. Robert went out next, unwilling to take any risks investing.</p><p>\nThe sharks continued pushing Michael to come clean about his true valuation since he was unwilling to accept the $90,000 for 5% deal he originally asked for, and he finally agreed to reveal the real offer he had in mind, which was $750,000 for 5%. This assumed PlateTopper was worth $15 million that day, an assumption the sharks were not eager to make.</p><p>\nMark Cuban, undeterred by the seemingly wishy-washy behavior shown by Michael, asked him how much a line of credit would be worth to him. Michael excused himself from the tank to call his younger brother, and when he returned, he asked for $1.5 million in exchange for 10% equity. With that, Mark went out.</p><p>\nWhen Michael started to counter Mark, rather than talk to Lori about her offer, she amended her offer again, to $90,000 for 10% equity. Michael countered with 5% for the $90,000, and asked if any sharks wanted to come back in, even asking if the sharks would have a bidding war for his company. The sharks adamantly rejected this, and Lori said she would do $90,000 for 8% equity if Michael accepted immediately.</p><p>\nFinally, Michael accepted the offer and the deal was closed.

The rebranding coincided with an investment from Patrick Schwarzenegger, son of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who later appeared on Shark Tank with his company, <a href=\"https://sharktankrecap.com/mosh-update-season-15/\">Mosh</a>.</p><p>\nOur Sunniva Super Coffee update found that the company expanded its product line to include creamers in 2019. It secured a $25 million investment from prominent venture capitalists, including Aaron Rodgers' company, Rx3 Ventures.</p><p>\nThe investment secured Sunniva Super Coffee's place in the competitive beverage market. Forbes recognized the brothers in their prestigious 30 Under 30 list in 2019. By 2020, Kitu Life's sales had skyrocketed to $55 million.</p><p>\nThe company's investor pool gained star power with former NBA star Baron Davis joining, followed by celebrities Alex Rodriguez (A-Rod) and Jennifer Lopez.</p><p>\nIn 2021, Sunniva Super Coffee (Kitu Life) appointed Rosanna Godden, formerly the finance vice president at Whole Foods Market, as its chief financial officer.</p><p>\nThe company underwent a leadership change in 2022. Rosanna Godden departed her role as CFO, and Tyler Ricks, a seasoned executive with experience at major coffee and tea companies, was welcomed as the new CEO.</p><p>\nDespite the leadership shift, Sunniva Super Coffee maintained its impressive financial performance. The company projected sales of $97 million for 2021 and boasted a valuation of $400 million.</p><p>\nA critical factor in this success was a strategic partnership forged with Anheuser-Busch in late 2020.</p><p>\nThis deal granted Sunniva Super Coffee access to a vast distribution network, allowing them to place their products in major retailers like Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Target, and numerous convenience stores nationwide.</p><p>\nIn 2021, the company secured an additional $106 million in investment, pushing its valuation to a staggering $500 million.</p><p>\nWhile their products were only available in approximately 40% of U.S. retail outlets, Kitu Life had already established itself as the third-largest bottled coffee manufacturer in the country, trailing only Starbucks and Dunkin'.</p><p>\nThey brokered an Anheuser-Busch partnership, which promised to expand their reach further, potentially propelling them to the number one position.</p><p>\nIn April 2022, Sunniva Super Coffee's sales projection crossed the $100 million mark. In May, it announced a partnership with rapper Vanilla Ice to <a href=\"https://drinksupercoffee.com/products/coffee/vanilla-super-coffee/\">promote its new Vanilla Iced Latte flavor. </a></p><p>\nKitu Life is exploring an initial public offering (IPO) as a means to fuel global expansion. By February 2023, Kitu Life announced that 2022 sales had reached a new high of $124 million.</p><p>\nSo, despite leaving Shark Tank without a deal, we're calling this Sunniva Super Coffee update a success!</p>\n",

Jennie tried to brush past, saying she was “just four years in” and it was too early to expect profits, but the sharks disagreed. How could a company generate $1 million in sales and see no return on investment? For the sharks, this was a massive red flag.</p><p>\nRobert asked how much money Jennie was losing, and Jennie said she was losing $10,000 per month. He asked how much she lost last year, and Jennie claimed that she didn’t know. She violated the Shark Tank cardinal rule– know thy numbers!</p><p>\nJennie continued peeling back layers, and revealed that she had invested $380,000 into her product, and also had taken on a collection of “non-equity investors.” The sharks were stunned again, and Mark asked what the investors got for their money if not equity.</p><p>\nJennie said that these investors were receiving 9% of all revenue off the top until their money was paid back. Mark asked how much money she took from these investors, and Jennie answered that she had accepted $900,000 from them.</p><p>\nKevin asked how much of the $900,000 Jennie had already paid back, and she said “not very much.” With the truth finally coming to light, the sharks would fall like dominoes.

He said this was the reason why solar “doesn’t work,” wind “doesn’t work,” and why The Green Garmento “won’t work.” He was out.</p><p>\nMark left the tank with a lesson. He said that many investors followed her path, accruing debt under the assumption that more money would make their business successful. They, and Jennie, would learn the hard way that “debt is not your friend.” With that, Mark was out. The last shark remaining was Daymond, and he didn't remain long.
